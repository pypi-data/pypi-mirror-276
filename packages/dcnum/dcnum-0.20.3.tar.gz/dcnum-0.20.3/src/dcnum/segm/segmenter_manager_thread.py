        Parameters
        ----------
        segmenter:
            The segmenter instance to use.
        image_data:
            The image data to use. This can be background-corrected
            or not (hence the type hint), depending on `segmenter`
        slot_states:
            This is an utf-8 shared array whose length defines how many slots
            are available. The segmenter will only ever perform the
            segmentation for a free slot. A free slot means a value of "s"
            (for "task is with segmenter"). After the segmenter has done
            its job for a slot, the slot value will be set to "e" (for
            "task is with feature extractor").
        slot_chunks:
            For each slot in `slot_states`, this shared array defines
            on which chunk in `image_data` the segmentation took place.
        bg_off:
            1d array containing additional background image offset values
            that are added to each background image before subtraction
            from the input image
        debug:
            Whether to run in debugging mode (more verbose messages and
            CPU-based segmentation is done in one single thread instead
            of in multiple subprocesses).

        Notes
        -----
        This manager keeps a list `labels_list` which enumerates the
        slots just like `slot_states` and `slot_chunks` do. For each
        slot, this list contains the labeled image data (integer-valued)
        for the input `image_data` chunks.

        The working principle of this `SegmenterManagerThread` allows
        the user to define a fixed number of slots on which the segmenter
        can work on. For instance, if the segmenter is a CPU-based segmenter,
        it does not make sense to have more than one slot (because feature
        extraction should not take place at the same time). But if the
        segmenter is a GPU-based segmenter, then it makes sense to have
        more than one slot, so CPU and GPU can work in parallel.
