* Seawater and Carbon Chemistry
ESBMTK provides several classes that abstract the handling of basin geometry, seawater chemistry and air-sea gas exchange.

** Hypsography

For many modeling tasks, it is important to know a globally averaged hypsometric curve. ESBMTK will automatically create a suitable hypsography instance if a @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.esbmtk.Species()`@@ or @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.extended_classes.Reservoir()`@@ instance is specified with the geometry keyword as in the following example where the first list item denotes the upper depth datum, the second list item, the lower depth datum, and the last list item denotes the fraction of the total ocean area if the upper boundary would be at sea level.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
Reservoir(
    name="S_b",  # Name of reservoir group
    geometry=[-200, -800, 1],  # upper, lower, fraction
    concentration="0 mmol/kg",
    species=M.DIC,
    register=M,
)
print(f"M.S_b.area = {M.S_b.area:.2e}") # surface area at upper depth datum
print(f"M.S_b.sed_area = {M.S_b.sed_area:.2e}") # surface between upper and lower datum
print(f"M.S_b.volume = {M.S_b.volume:.2e}") # total volume
#+END_SRC
This will register 3 new instance variables, and also create a hypsometry instance at the model level that provides access to the following methods:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
#return the ocean area at a given depth in m**2
print(f"M.hyp.area(0) = {M.hyp.area(0):.2e}")

# return the area between 2 depth datums in m**2
print(f"M.hyp.area_dz(0, -200) = {M.hyp.area_dz(0, -200):.2e}")

# return the volume between 2 depth datums in m**3
print(f"M.hyp.volume(0,-200) = {M.hyp.volume(0,-200):.2e}")

# return the total surface area of earth in m**2
print(f"M.hyp.sa = {M.hyp.sa:.2e}")
#+END_SRC
The hypsometric data is based on the Scrippsâ€™ SRTM15+V2.5.5 grid (Tozer et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EA000658), which was down-sampled to a 5-minute grid before processing the hypsometry. 


** Seawater

ESBMTK provides a @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.seawater.SeawaterConstants()`@@ class that will be automatically instantiated when a @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.extended_classes.Reservoir()`@@ instance 
definition includes the =seawater_parameters= keyword. This keyword expects a dictionary that specifies temperature, salinity, and pressure for a given =Reservoirgroup=. The class methods and instance variables are accessible via the =swc= instance.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
Reservoir(
    name="S_b",  # box name
    geometry=[-200, -800, 1],  # upper, lower, fraction
    concentration={M.DIC: "2220 umol/kg", M.TA: "2300 umol/kg"},
    seawater_parameters={
        "T": 25,  # Deg celsius
        "P": 0,  # Bar
        "S": 35,  # PSU
    },
    register=M,
)
# Acess the sewater_parameters with the swc instance
print(f"M.S_b.density = {M.S_b.swc.density:.2e}")
#+END_SRC

Apart from density, this class will provide access to a host of instance parameters, e.g., equilibrium constants - see @@rst::py:meth:`esbmtk.seawater.SeawaterConstants.update_parameters()`@@ for the currently defined names. Most of these values are computed by =pyCO2SYS= (https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-15-2022). Using  =pyCO2SYS= provides access to a variety of parametrizations for the respective equilibrium constants, various pH scales, as well as different methods to calculate buffer factors. Unless explicitly specified in the model definition, ESBMTK uses the defaults set by pyCO2SYS. Note that when using the seawater class, the model concentration unit must be set to =mol/kg= as in the following example:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
M = Model(
    stop="6 Myr",  # end time of model
    max_timestep="1 kyr",  # upper limit of time step
    element=["Carbon"],  # list of element definitions
    concentration_unit="mol/kg",
    opt_k_carbonic=13,  # Use Millero 2006
    opt_pH_scale=1,  # 1:total, 3:free scale
    opt_buffers_mode=2, # carbonate, borate water alkalinity only
)
#+END_SRC

*** Caveats

- Seawater Parameters are only computed once when the =Reservoir= is instantiated, to provide an initial steady state. Subsequent changes to seawater chemistry or physical parameters do not affect the initial state.
- The =swc= instance provides a =show()= method listing most values. However, that list may not be comprehensive.
- See the pyCO2SYS documentation for a list of parameters and options https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- The code example =seawater_example.py= in the examples directory 
  

** Carbon Chemistry
*** pH
Unless explicitly requested (see above), pH will be reported on the total scale. The hydrogen ion concentration ([H^{+}]) is computed by pyCO2SYS based on the initial DIC and total alkalinity (TA) concentrations. Subsequent hydrogen concentration calculations use the iterative approach of Follows et al. 2005 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2005.05.004). 

Provided that the model has terms for DIC and TA, pH calculations for a given @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.extended_classes.Reservoir()`@@ instance are added using the @@rst::py:func:`esbmtk.bio_pump_functions0.carbonate_chemistry.add_carbonate_system_1()`@@ function:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
box_names = [A_sb, I_sb, P_sb, H_sb]  # list of Reservoir handles
add_carbonate_system_1(box_names)
#+END_SRC

This will create Species @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.esbmtk.Species()`@@ instances for =Hplus= and =CO2aq=. After running the model, the resulting concentration data is available in the usual manner:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
A_sb.Hplus.c
A_sb.CO2aq.c
#+END_SRC
The remaining carbonate species are calculated during post-processing (see the @@rst::py:func:`esbmtk.post_processing.carbonate_system_1_pp()`@@ function) and are available as
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
A_sb.pH
A_sb.HCO3
A_sb.CO3
A_sb.Omega
#+END_SRC
**** Notes:
 - The resulting concentration data depends on the choice of equilibrium constants and how they are calculated (see the =opt_k_carbonic=, =opt_buffers_mode= keywords above).
 - The data from post-processing is currently available as @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.extended_classes.VectorData()`@@ instance, rather than as @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.esbmtk.Species()`@@ instance.
 - Species that use carbonate system 2 (see below), do not need to use carbonate system 1
 - ESBMTK will print a warning message of the pH changes by more than 0.01 units per time step. However, this is only a crude measure, since the solver also uses interpolation between integration steps. So this may not catch all possible scenarios.

*** Carbonate burial and dissolution
Carbonate burial and dissolution use the parametrization proposed by Boudreau et al. 2010 (https://doi.org/10.1029/2009gb003654). The current ESBMTK implementation  has the following shortcomings:
 - It only considers Calcium dissolution/burial (although it would be easy to add Aragonite)
 - Results will only be correct as long as the depth of the saturation horizon remains below the upper depth datum of the deep-water box. Future versions will address this limitation.

The following figure provides an overview of the parametrizations and variables used by the  @@rst::py:func:`esbmtk.bio_pump_functions0.carbonate_chemistry.carbonate_system_2()`@@ and @@rst::py:func:`esbmtk.bio_pump_functions0.carbonate_chemistry.add_carbonate_system_2()`@@ functions.

Provided a given model has data for DIC & TA, and that the carbonate export flux is known, =carbonate_system_2= can be added to a Reservoir instance in the following way:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
surface_boxes: tp.List = [M.L_b]
deep_boxes: tp.List = [M.D_b]
export_fluxes: tp.List = M.flux_summary(filter_by="PIC_DIC L_b", return_list=True)

add_carbonate_system_2(
        r_db=deep_boxes,  # list of reservoir groups
        r_sb=surface_boxes,  # list of reservoir groups
        carbonate_export_fluxes=export_fluxes,  # list of export fluxes
        z0=-200,  # depth of shelf
        alpha=alpha,  # dissolution coefficient, typically around 0.6
    )
#+END_SRC
Notes:
 - boxes and fluxes are lists, since in some models there is more than one surface box (e.g., models that resolve individual ocean basins)
 - ESBMTK only considers the sediment area to 6000 mbsl. The area contributed by the elevations below 6000 mbsl is negligible, and this constrain simplifies the hypsographic fit.
 - The total sediment area of a given =Reservoir= is known provided the box-geometry was specified correctly.
 - The @@rst::py:func:`esbmtk.bio_pump_functions0.carbonate_chemistry.carbonate_system_2()`@@ function only returns [H^{+}] and the dissolution flux for  given box. It does not return the burial flux.
 - Please study the actual model implementations provided in the examples folder.

*** Post-Processing
As with =carbonate_system_1= the remaining carbonate species are not part of the equation system, rather they are calculated once a solution has been found. Since the solver does not store the carbonate export fluxes, one first has to calculate the relevant fluxes from the concentration data in the model solution. This is however model dependent (i.e., export productivity as a function of residence time, or as a function of upwelling flux), and as such post-processing of =carbonate_system_2=  is not done automatically, but has to be initiated manually, e.g., like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
# get CaCO3_export in mol/year
CaCO3_export = M.CaCO3_export.to(f"{M.f_unit}").magnitude
carbonate_system_2_pp(
    M.D_b,  # Reservoir
    CaCO3_export,  # CaCO3 export flux
    200,  # z0
    6000,  # zmax
)
#+END_SRC

This will compute all carbonate species similar to =carbonate_system_1_pp=, and in addition calculate:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
M.D_b.Fburial  # CaCO3 burial flux mol/year
M.D_b.Fdiss  # CaCO3 dissolution flux mol/year
M.D_b.zsat  # Saturation depth in mbsl
M.D_b.zcc  # CCD depth in mbsl
M.D_b.zsnow  # Snowline depth in mbsl
#+END_SRC
see  the @@rst::py:func:`esbmtk.post_processing.carbonate_system_2_pp()`@@ function for details.


** Gas Exchange
ESBMTK implements gas exchange across the Air-Sea interface as a @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.connections.Species2Species()`@@ instance, between a @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.extended_classes.GasReservoir()`@@ and a @@rst::py:class:`esbmtk.esbmtk.Species()`@@ instance. In the following example, we first declare a =Gasreservoir= and then connect it with a regular surface box. Note that the CO_{2} gas transfer calculation requires that the respective surface reservoir carries the =CO2aq= tracer as calculated by the @@rst::py:func:`esbmtk.bio_pump_functions0.carbonate_chemistry_carbonate_system_1.()`@@ function since the gas-transfer depends on the dissolved CO_{2} rather than on the DIC concentration.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
GasReservoir(
    name="CO2_At",
    species=M.CO2,
    species_ppm="280 ppm",
    register=M,
)

Species2Species(  # Example for CO2
    source=M.CO2_At,  # GasReservoir
    sink=M.L_b.DIC,  # Reservoir
    species=M.CO2,
    ref_species=M.H_b.CO2aq,
    solubility=M.H_b.swc.SA_co2,
    area=M.L_b.area,  # surface area
    id="L_b_GEX",  # connection id
    piston_velocity="4.8 m/d",
    water_vapor_pressure=M.H_b.swc.p_H2O,
    register=M,
    ctype="gasexchange",
)
#+END_SRC

Defining gas transfer for O2  uses the same approach, but note the use of the =solubility= and =ref_species= keywords. At present, ESBMTK only carries the solubility constants for CO_{2} and O_2.
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
Species2Species(  # Example for O2
    source=M.O2_At,  # GasReservoir
    sink=M.L_b.O2,  # Reservoir
    species=M.O2,
    ref_species=M.L_b.O2,
    solubility=M._b.swc.SA_o2,
    area=M._b.area,
    piston_velocity="4.8 m/d",
    water_vapor_pressure=M.L_b.swc.p_H2O,
    id=f"O2_gas_exchange_L_b",
    register=M,
    ctype="gasexchange",
)
#+END_SRC



** pCO_{2} Dependent Weathering
ESBMTK defines a simple power law function to calculate pCO_{2} dependent weathering fluxes (see e.g., Walker and Hays, 1981, https://doi.org/10.1029/jc086ic10p09776):
\[f =  A \times  f_{0} \times  \left(\frac{pCO_{2}}{p_{0}CO_{2}}\right)^{c}\]
where $A$ denotes the area, $f_0$ the weathering flux at $p_{0}CO_2$, pCO_{2} the CO_2 partial pressure at a given time $t$, $p_{0}CO_2$ the reference partial pressure of CO_2 and $c$ a constant.  See the @@rst::py:func:`esbmtk.processes.weathering()`@@ function for details. Within the context of ESBMTK, weathering fluxes are just another connection type:
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
Species2Species(  # CaCO3 weathering
    source=M.Fw.DIC,  # source of flux
    sink=M.L_b.DIC,
    reservoir_ref=M.CO2_At,  # pCO2
    ctype="weathering",
    id="wca",
    scale=1,  # optional, defaults to 1
    ex=0.2,  # exponent c
    pco2_0="280 ppm",  # reference pCO2
    rate="12 Tmol/a",  # rate at pco2_0
    register=M,
)
#+END_SRC
