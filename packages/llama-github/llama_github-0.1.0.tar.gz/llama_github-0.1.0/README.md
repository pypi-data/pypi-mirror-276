Llama-github is an open-source Python library that empowers LLM Chatbots, AI Agents, and Auto-dev Agents to conduct Retrieval from actively selected GitHub public contents (Repository, Issue, Code). It Augments through LLMs and Generates context for any coding question, in order to streamline the development of sophisticated AI-driven applications.

## Installation
```
pip install llama-github
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use llama-github:

```python
from llama_github import GithubRAG

# Initialize GithubRAG with your credentials
github_rag = GithubRAG(
    github_access_token="your_github_access_token", 
    openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key", # Optional in Simple Mode
    jina_api_key="your_jina_api_key" # Optional - unless you want high concurrency production deployment (s.jina.ai API will be used in llama-github)
)

# Retrieve context for a coding question (simple_mode is default set to False)
query = "How to create a NumPy array in Python?"
context = github_rag.retrieve_context(
    query, # In professional mode, one query will take nearly 1 min to generate final contexts. You could set log level to INFO to monitor the retrieval progress
    # simple_mode = True
)

print(context)
```
