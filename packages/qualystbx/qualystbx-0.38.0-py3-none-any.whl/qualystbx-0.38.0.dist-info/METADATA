# Test Release - QualysTBX - Qualys Toolbox Project

**Note: This is a test release and should not be used in production.**

**QualysTBX** is a comprehensive toolbox project designed to provide various utilities for interacting with Qualys services. The initial offering within this project is the **Policy Merge** tool, which allows users to selectively merge Control IDs (CIDs) from one policy into another, ensuring streamlined and consistent policy updates. As the project evolves, additional tools will be developed and integrated to meet emerging needs and enhance functionality.

## Qualys Tools Included in QualysTBX

### 1. Policy Merge

**Description:** The Policy Merge tool in QualysTBX allows you to seamlessly merge specific Control IDs (CIDs) from an existing policy into a new policy. This tool is essential for maintaining up-to-date and consistent security policies, especially when integrating changes from legacy policies into current ones. It supports efficient policy management by allowing selective merging of controls, ensuring that only relevant and necessary updates are incorporated.


## Prerequisites Python Module on Ubuntu 22.04
    - Install Python Latest Version, greater than 3.9

## First time install or upgrade of QualysTBX

| Step Number | Code to Run (Linux/Mac)                                             | Code to Run (Windows)                                                | Description                                                                                                |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | `cd [your data storage directory]`                                  | `cd [your data storage directory]`                                   | Change to your data storage directory where you want to store your environment and logs.                   |
| 2 | `python -m venv qtbx_venv`                                          | `python -m venv qtbx_venv`                                           | Create a Python virtual environment named `qtbx_venv` for the `qualystbx` tool.                            |
| 3 | `source ./qtbx_venv/bin/activate`                                   | `.\qtbx_venv\Scripts\activate`                                       | Activate the Python virtual environment. This step needs to be done each time you want to run `qualystbx`. |
| 4 | `python -m pip install --upgrade qualystbx lxml requests xmltodict` | `python -m pip install --upgrade qualystbx lxml requests xmltodict` | Install the necessary packages: `qualystbx`, `lxml`, `requests`, and `xmltodict`.                           |

**Linux/Mac Example (bash script)**

```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/your/data/storage        # Change to your data storage directory
python -m venv qtbx_venv             # Create a Python virtual environment
source ./qtbx_venv/bin/activate      # Activate the Python virtual environment
python -m pip install --upgrade qualystbx lxml requests xmltodict   # Install the necessary packages
```
**Windows Example (batch script)**

```bat
cd \path\to\your\data\storage
python -m venv qtbx_venv
.\qtbx_venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade qualystbx lxml requests xmltodict   # Install the necessary packages
```

## Operations You Can Perform with QualysTBX

### Policy Merge

**Description:** Execute the `policy_merge` command in `qualystbx` with the specified new policy ID, old policy ID, and comma-separated CID list. Optionally, add `--log_to_console` to log to the console. If not specified, logs will be saved to `[your data storage directory]/qtbx_venv/qualystbx/qtbx_home/policy_merge/log/policy_merge.log`.

**Command:**
```sh
qualystbx --execute policy_merge --new_policy_id=[new policy id] --old_policy_id=[old policy id] --cid_list=[comma separated cid list] [--log_to_console]
```

### Explanation of Each Option

- **new_policy_id**: The ID of the new policy into which the CIDs will be merged.
- **old_policy_id**: The ID of the old policy from which the CIDs will be sourced.
- **cid_list**: A comma-separated list of CIDs to be merged from the old policy to the new policy.
- **--log_to_console**: (Optional) If this flag is included, logs will be printed to the console. If not, logs will be saved to the specified log file.

### Path Differences Between Windows and Linux/Mac

- **Linux/Mac Log Path**: `[your data storage directory]/qtbx_venv/qualystbx/qtbx_home/policy_merge/log/policy_merge.log`
- **Windows Log Path**: `[your data storage directory]\qtbx_venv\qualystbx\qtbx_home\policy_merge\log\policy_merge.log`

### Example Command

- **Linux/Mac**:
  ```sh
  qualystbx --execute policy_merge --new_policy_id=12345 --old_policy_id=67890 --cid_list=111,222,333 --log_to_console
  ```
  or without logging to console:
  ```sh
  qualystbx --execute policy_merge --new_policy_id=12345 --old_policy_id=67890 --cid_list=111,222,333
  ```

- **Windows**:
  ```cmd
  qualystbx --execute policy_merge --new_policy_id=12345 --old_policy_id=67890 --cid_list=111,222,333 --log_to_console

# Logging

Logging fields are pipe delimited with some formatting for raw readability.  You can easily import this data into excel, 
 a database for analysis or link this data to a monitoring system.

# Application Monitoring
- To monitor the application for issues, the logging format includes a logging level.  
- Monitoring for ERROR will help identify issues and tend to the overall health of the applicaiton operation.

# Securing Your Application in the Data Center
Follow your corporate procedures for securing your application.  A key recommendation is to use a password vault
or remote invocation method that passes the credentials at run time so the password isn't stored on the system.

## Password Vault
QualysETL provides options to inject credentials at runtime in memory.

Qualys recommends customers move to a password vault of their choosing to operate this applications credentials.
By creating functions to obtain credentials from your corporations password vault, you can improve 
the security of your application by separating the password from the machine, injecting the credentials at runtime.  

One way customers can do this is through a work load management solution, where the external work load management
system ( Ex. Autosys ) schedules jobs injecting the required credentials to QualysETL application at runtime.  This eliminates
the need to store credentials locally on your system.

If you are unfamiliar with password vaults, here is one example from Hashicorp.
