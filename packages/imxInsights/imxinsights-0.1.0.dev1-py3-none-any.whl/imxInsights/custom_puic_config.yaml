# not every object does have a puic, so we need to set a custom unique key.
# assuming objects without a puic are extending a puic object.
# a set of attributes in the root of the object can make it unique,
# example: FlankProtectionConfiguration can ref to same object but the position makes it unique

# <ObjectType>:
#  - <Reff attribute>
#  - [<attribute 1>, < attribute 2>]
