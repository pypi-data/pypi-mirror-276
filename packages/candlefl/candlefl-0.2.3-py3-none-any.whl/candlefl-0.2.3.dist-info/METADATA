## Features

- Python 3.6+ support. Built using ```torch-1.10.1```, ```torchvision-0.11.2```, and ```pytorch-lightning-1.5.7```.
- Customizable implementations for state-of-the-art deep learning [models](#available-models) which can be trained in federated or non-federated settings.
- Supports finetuning of the pre-trained deep learning models, allowing for faster training using transfer learning.
- PyTorch LightningDataModule wrappers for the most commonly used [datasets](#available-datasets) to reduce the boilerplate code before experiments.
- Built using the bottom-up approach for the datamodules and models which ensures abstractions while allowing for customization.
- Provides implementation of the federated learning (FL) samplers, aggregators, and wrappers, to prototype FL experiments on-the-go.
- Backwards compatible with the PyTorch LightningDataModule, LightningModule, loggers, and DevOps tools.
- More details about the examples and usage can be found [below](#examples-and-usage).

## Installation
### Stable Release
As of now, ```candlefl``` is available on PyPI and can be installed using the following command in your terminal:
```
$ pip install candlefl
```
This is the preferred method to install ```candlefl``` with the most stable release.
If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed, this [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide you through the process.

## Examples and Usage
Although ```candlefl``` is primarily built for quick prototyping of federated learning experiments, the models, datasets, and abstractions can also speed up the non-federated learning experiments. In this section, we will explore examples and usages under both the settings.

### Non-Federated Learning
The following steps should be followed on a high-level to train a non-federated learning experiment. We are using the ```EMNIST (MNIST)``` dataset and ```densenet121``` for this example.

1. Import the relevant modules.
	```python
	from candlefl.datamodules.emnist import EMNISTDataModule
	from candlefl.models.wrapper.emnist import MNISTEMNIST
	```

	```python
	import pytorch_lightning as pl
	from pytorch_lightning.loggers import TensorBoardLogger
	from pytorch_lightning.callbacks import (
		ModelCheckpoint,
		LearningRateMonitor,
		DeviceStatsMonitor,
		ModelSummary,
		ProgressBar,
		...
	)
	```
	For more details, view the full list of PyTorch Lightning [callbacks](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/callbacks.html#callback) and [loggers](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common/loggers.html#loggers) on the official website.
2. Setup the PyTorch Lightning trainer.
	```python
	trainer = pl.Trainer(
		...
		logger=[
			TensorBoardLogger(
				name=experiment_name,
				save_dir=os.path.join(checkpoint_save_path, experiment_name),
			)
		],
		callbacks=[
			ModelCheckpoint(save_weights_only=True, mode="max", monitor="val_acc"),
			LearningRateMonitor("epoch"),
			DeviceStatsMonitor(),
			ModelSummary(),
			ProgressBar(),
		],
		...
	)
	```
	More details about the PyTorch Lightning [Trainer API](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common/trainer.html#) can be found on their official website.

3. Prepare the dataset using the wrappers provided by ```candlefl.datamodules```.
	```python
	datamodule = EMNISTDataModule(dataset_name="mnist")
	datamodule.prepare_data()
	datamodule.setup()
	```

4. Initialize the model using the wrappers provided by ```candlefl.models.wrappers```.
	```python
	# check if the model can be loaded from a given checkpoint
	if (checkpoint_load_path) and os.path.isfile(checkpoint_load_path):
		model = MNISTEMNIST(
			"densenet121", "adam", {"lr": 0.001}
			).load_from_checkpoint(checkpoint_load_path)
	else:
		pl.seed_everything(42)
		model = MNISTEMNIST("densenet121", "adam", {"lr": 0.001})
		trainer.fit(model, datamodule.train_dataloader(), datamodule.val_dataloader())
	```

5. Collect the results.
	```python
	val_result = trainer.test(
		model, test_dataloaders=datamodule.val_dataloader(), verbose=True
	)
	test_result = trainer.test(
		model, test_dataloaders=datamodule.test_dataloader(), verbose=True
	)
	```

6. The corresponding files for the experiment (model checkpoints and logger metadata) will be stored at ```default_root_dir``` argument given to the PyTorch Lightning ```Trainer``` object in Step 2. For this experiment, we use the [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) logger. To view the logs (and related plots and metrics), go to the ```default_root_dir``` path and find the Tensorboard log files. Upload the files to the Tensorboard Development portal following the instructions [here](https://tensorboard.dev/#get-started). Once the log files are uploaded, a unique url to your experiment will be generated which can be shared with ease! An example can be found [here](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/Q1tw19FySLSjLN6CW5DaUw/).

7. Note that, ```candlefl``` is compatible with all the loggers supported by PyTorch Lightning. More information about the PyTorch Lightning loggers can be found [here](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common/loggers.html#loggers).


### Federated Learning
The following steps should be followed on a high-level to train a federated learning experiment.

1. Pick a dataset and use the ```datamodules``` to create federated data shards with iid or non-iid distribution.
	```python
	def get_datamodule() -> EMNISTDataModule:
		datamodule: EMNISTDataModule = EMNISTDataModule(
			dataset_name=SUPPORTED_DATASETS_TYPE.MNIST, train_batch_size=10
		)
		datamodule.prepare_data()
		datamodule.setup()
		return datamodule

    agent_data_shard_map = get_agent_data_shard_map().federated_iid_dataloader(
        num_workers=fl_params.num_agents,
        workers_batch_size=fl_params.local_train_batch_size,
    )
	```
2. Use the TorchFL ```agents``` module and the  ```models``` module to initialize the global model, agents, and distribute their models.
	```python
	def initialize_agents(
		fl_params: FLParams, agent_data_shard_map: Dict[int, DataLoader]
	) -> List[V1Agent]:
		"""Initialize agents."""
		agents = []
		for agent_id in range(fl_params.num_agents):
			agent = V1Agent(
				id=agent_id,
				model=MNISTEMNIST(
					model_name=EMNIST_MODELS_ENUM.MOBILENETV3SMALL,
					optimizer_name=OPTIMIZERS_TYPE.ADAM,
					optimizer_hparams={"lr": 0.001},
					model_hparams={"pre_trained": True, "feature_extract": True},
					fl_hparams=fl_params,
				),
				data_shard=agent_data_shard_map[agent_id],
			)
			agents.append(agent)
		return agents

	global_model = MNISTEMNIST(
        model_name=EMNIST_MODELS_ENUM.MOBILENETV3SMALL,
        optimizer_name=OPTIMIZERS_TYPE.ADAM,
        optimizer_hparams={"lr": 0.001},
        model_hparams={"pre_trained": True, "feature_extract": True},
        fl_hparams=fl_params,
    )

	all_agents = initialize_agents(fl_params, agent_data_shard_map)
	```
3. Initiliaze an ```FLParam``` object with the desired FL hyperparameters and pass it on to the ```Entrypoint``` object which will abstract the training.
	```python
    fl_params = FLParams(
        experiment_name="iid_mnist_fedavg_10_agents_5_sampled_50_epochs_mobilenetv3small_latest",
        num_agents=10,
        global_epochs=10,
        local_epochs=2,
        sampling_ratio=0.5,
    )
    entrypoint = Entrypoint(
        global_model=global_model,
        global_datamodule=get_agent_data_shard_map(),
        fl_hparams=fl_params,
        agents=all_agents,
        aggregator=FedAvgAggregator(all_agents=all_agents),
        sampler=RandomSampler(all_agents=all_agents),
    )
    entrypoint.run()
	```


## Available Models
For the initial release, ```candlefl``` will only support state-of-the-art computer vision models. The following table summarizes the available models, support for pre-training, and the possibility of feature-extracting. Please note that the models have been tested with all the available datasets. Therefore, the link to the tests will be provided in the next section.

## Available Datasets
Following datasets have been wrapped inside a ```LightningDataModule``` and made available for the initial release of ```candlefl```. To add a new dataset, check the source code in ```candlefl.datamodules```, add tests, and create a PR with ```Features``` tag.
