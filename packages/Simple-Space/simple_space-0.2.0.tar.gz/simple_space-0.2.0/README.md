## Submodules
1. Points

    - dimentions.py:
     Contains the Dim3 and Dim2 classes for 3D and 2D point data processing and visualization.
2. ImageRelated

    - enhancements.py: Provides functions for image enhancement, including erosion and dilation.
    - basics.py: Contains basic image processing utilities like edge detection and color inversion.

## Dim3 Class

The Dim3 class offers tools for visualizing and processing 3D point data in Python, using libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, and scipy.

### Features

- **Rotate 3D Points:** Rotate points around a specified axis by a given angle in degrees.
- **Plot 3D Points/Mesh:** Visualize 3D points or a mesh, with customizable visual attributes.
- **Create Grayscale Image from 3D Points:** Project 3D points onto a 2D plane using the z-coordinate for intensity.
- **Fill Points in Binary Image:** Use morphological dilation to fill gaps in binary images.

### Usage

#### Initializing the Class

```python

from SimpleS.Points.dimentions import Dim3

# Or even :

from SimpleS import Dim3
```
```python
# But I recommend You Simply Use this one:

from SimpleS.Dim3 import *

# This one Lets you use all the functions inside Dim3 class without any initialize word;
# FOR EXAMPLE:

Dim3.rotate_points()

# WOULD BE JUST:

rotate_3d_points()
```
**If you encounter any trouble determining the specifics of an import, such as which functions it includes, simply use the dir() function:**
```python
from SimpleS import Dim3

dir(Dim3)
```
This will show you the names of all functions inside the Dim3 class.

After that, we will return to our simpler method:

```python
from SimpleS.Dim3 import *
```

#### Rotating 3D Points

```python
rotated_points = rotate_points(points, 45, 'z')
```

#### Plotting 3D Points or Mesh

```python
plot_points(vertices, faces)
```


#### Creating a Grayscale Image from 3D Points

```python
image = create_bool_image_from_points(points)
```


#### Filling Points in a Binary Image

```python
filled_image = fill_points(binary_image)
```
For more detailed information on each method, please refer to the inline documentation within the class methods.


## ImageRelated Scripts : enhancements.py

### Introduction
This Python script, titled "enhancements", is an enhanced version of the original image processing examples provided by OpenCV. It includes functionalities for applying erosion and dilatation transformations to images. This script can be used for educational purposes or integrated into larger image processing projects.

### Features
- **Erosion and Dilatation**: Apply morphological transformations to enhance or reduce features in images.
- **Flexible File Handling**: Load images from file paths or directly from images in memory.
- **Visualization**: Compare original and transformed images side by side.
- **Save Results**: Optionally save the resulting images with a timestamp and transformation details.

### Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script is compatible with Python 3.6 or higher.

### Usage

To use this script, you need to create an instance of the ErosAndDilat class with either a path to an image file or an image object. Here's a quick example on how to use the class:

```python

from SimpleS.enhancements import ErosAndDilat

# Initialize with an image path
image_processor = ErosAndDilat('path/to/your/image.jpg')

# Perform erosion and dilatation, display results, and save them
image_processor.main(eros=True, dilate=True, show=True, save=True)
```
### Parameters

- eros: Enable erosion (default: True)
- dilate: Enable dilatation (default: True)
- show: Display the images using matplotlib (default: True)
- save: Save the images to disk (default: False)
- save_path: Directory to save the images (default: 'results')
- file_name: Base file name for saved images (default: None)

### Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the OpenCV community for providing the base examples which were enhanced in this project. Also, check out the original script and documentation at OpenCV GitHub.

## ImageRelated Scripts : basics.py

This script, titled "basics", provides a collection of image processing utilities written in Python. These functions can be used for tasks such as edge detection, image inversion, and binary image creation.
