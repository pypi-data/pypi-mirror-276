# Richie Open edX Synchronization application

The aim of this Django application is to synchronize the Open edX courses to the Richie marketing site.

There is also a Django command that permit to synchronize all existing courses.

## Open edX compatibility

This app has been tested with Open edX Juniper, but it should run on newer versions.

## Making a release

Making a release is automated. The choice between a minor or a revision type of release is
determined by the presence of an addition, a change or a removal. A revision release is made
if only fixes are present in the changelog, otherwise a minor release is made.

For example, to release and commit all changes:

```
bin/release --commit
```

If you consider that the changelog contains breaking changes, you can force a major release
by passing the parameter `--major`.


To release but without committing the changes:

```
bin/release --major
```

To release and committing the changes:

```
bin/release --commit
```

After merging release commits to the master branch, you can tag them automatically by running:

```
bin/tag -c
```
