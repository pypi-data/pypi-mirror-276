	description:
		
		journal entry 1:
		
			For example, voter 8 with 2% of the voting portion,
			delegates 0.2% voting abilities to 5 physicals.
			
			Ergo, there are 5 delegate physicals.
				1. voter 8 {2%} -> delegate 1, 0.2%
				2. voter 8 {2%} -> delegate 2, 0.2%
				3. voter 8 {2%} -> delegate 3, 0.2%
				4. voter 8 {2%} -> delegate 4, 0.2%
				5. voter 8 {2%} -> delegate 5, 0.2%
