	<h2>summary</h2>
		
		These are aggregations (like balance sheets) of the
		activity summarized, whereby preceeding genes and
		sequences are not necessary for petitioning new
		sequences.
		
		Every 100 blocks or so, a squash is generated
		that aggregates everything before the squash.
		
			Therefore, new businesses can start voting
			without having to retrieve the entire
			history of the universe.
