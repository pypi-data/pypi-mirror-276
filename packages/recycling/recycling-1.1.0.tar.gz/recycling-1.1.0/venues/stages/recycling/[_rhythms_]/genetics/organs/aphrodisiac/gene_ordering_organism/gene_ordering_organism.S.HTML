	<h1>gene ordering organism</h1>
		# genome ordering organisms	
			
	<h2>summary</h2>
	
		Each organism has preferences on
		the organism that should petition
		the order each gene.
		
	
	<h2>possibilities</h2>
		A gene and a the genome condense could
		literally be generated every time.
		
	
	<h2>questions</h2>

			
	<h2>scenario 1</h2>
		
		abstract:
			moves:
				"gene ready"
				"gene solid signatures received"
				
			questions:
				multiple organisms receive:
					"gene solid signatures received"
			
		
		rhythm:
			organism_1 [ organism_9, organism_4, organism_2 ]
			organism_2 [ organism_9, organism_4, organism_2 ]
