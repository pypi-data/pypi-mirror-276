voter queue

	priorities:
		priority 1:
			This should be part of every batch.
			
			As in, instrument and voter modifactions
			occur simultaneously per batch.
			
			That way, there's no confusion about
			who the voters are.
		

	description:
		voters are added to the voter queue,
		and then are added to the aggregate,
		when the next aggregate is calculated.
		
		Voter aggregates and ledger aggregates
		could be synchronized.
