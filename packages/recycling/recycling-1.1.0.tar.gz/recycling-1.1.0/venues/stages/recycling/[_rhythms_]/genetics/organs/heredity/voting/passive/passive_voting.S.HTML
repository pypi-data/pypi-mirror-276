		[ ] who chooses transaction order per block?
			
			could be rotational based on order in which
			accounts were added to the stamina database.
				
				for example:
					account 1 [1000 staked]
					account 3 [1000 staked]
					account 4
					account 5
					account 2
			
				operation:
					stake 1000
					unstake 1000
					
					unless stake goes to 0,
					order in stamina order 
					remains the same.
					
				conditionals:
					if account is non-responsive:
						accounts can vote to skip account in the order
						
						like after 5 seconds of non-reponsiveness,
						from the stamina leader, the tool could
						be programmed to propose going to the next tool in the order.
