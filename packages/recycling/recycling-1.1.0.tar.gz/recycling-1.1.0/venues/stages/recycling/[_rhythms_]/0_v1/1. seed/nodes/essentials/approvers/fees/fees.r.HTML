fees:
	
	1 treasure = 1 vote


	possibilities:
		1.
			Voters could get proportional adjusted fees based on 
			how much they stake.
			
				That is the correlation between stake and
				fees payed isn't necessary 1:1, might have bracket-esque
				adjustments.
			
		2.
			The same fee amount for every voter.
			This probably would not work.
