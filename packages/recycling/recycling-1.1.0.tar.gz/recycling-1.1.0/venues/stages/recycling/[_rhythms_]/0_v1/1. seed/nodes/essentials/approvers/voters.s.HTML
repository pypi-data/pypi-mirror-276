		<h2>maybe voters is always an aggregate</h2>
		<p>
			Voters need to wait until the next voter aggregation to join.
			This makes it easy to calculate the fraction of voting power
			that a voter has.

	<h2>how is list of voters determined?</h2>
	
		voters authorize other voters.
		
		possibility of individual voters and delegate voters.
		
		so start with 1 voter: {
			"voting ellipse": {
				"private": "",
				"public": ""
			}
		}
	
		
	
	<h2>secure approvals</h2>
		could be:
			1 creator private ellipse for:
				making proposals 
				generating approver keys
			
			1 voting private ellipse for approving proposals
		
			That way if the voting ellipse is stolen,
			a new one can be generated from the creator ellipse.
