### `location_postcode.csv.xz`

A dump of the location_postcode table in a Nominatim database. Nominatim creates this database from OpenStreetMap data using the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    COALESCE(plx.country_code, get_country_code(ST_Centroid(pl.geometry))) as country_code,
    pl.address->'postcode' as postcode,
    COALESCE(plx.centroid, ST_Centroid(pl.geometry)) as geometry
  FROM place AS pl
  LEFT OUTER JOIN placex AS plx
         ON pl.osm_id = plx.osm_id AND pl.osm_type = plx.osm_type
WHERE 
	pl.address ? 'postcode'
	AND pl.geometry IS NOT null
```
