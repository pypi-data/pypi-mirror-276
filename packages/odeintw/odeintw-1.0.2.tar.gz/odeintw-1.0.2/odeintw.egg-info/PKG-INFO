odeintw
=======

`odeintw` provides a wrapper of `scipy.integrate.odeint` that allows it to
handle complex and matrix differential equations.  That is, it can solve
equations of the form

    dZ/dt = F(Z, t, param1, param2, ...)

where `t` is real and `Z` is a real or complex array.

Since `odeintw` is just a wrapper of `scipy.integrate.odeint`, it requires
`scipy` to be installed.  SciPy 0.15 or greater is required, to avoid a
bug in `scipy.integrate.odeint` in older versions of SciPy.

See README.md at https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/odeintw for examples.
