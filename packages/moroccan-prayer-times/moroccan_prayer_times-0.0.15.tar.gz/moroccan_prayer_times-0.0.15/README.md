A command-line interface (CLI) application to fetch and display Moroccan prayer times for the current day or the next
prayer time remaining, using data provided by the official Moroccan Ministry of Habous and Islamic Affairs
website (https://habous.gov.ma/).

## Features

- Display today's prayer times for a selected Moroccan city
- Show the time remaining until the next prayer
- Configure the preferred city and language
- Caching of fetched prayer times for better performance
- Localization support for Arabic, English, and French languages

## Installation

You can install the package from PyPI using pip:

```shell
pip install moroccan-prayer-times
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the CLI application with the following commands:

```shell
prayertime help
```

This will display the list of available commands and their descriptions.

### Commands

- `prayertime today`: Display today's prayer times for the configured city.
- `prayertime next`: Show the time remaining until the next prayer.
- `prayertime config`: Display the current configuration (city and language).
- `prayertime setup`: Configure the preferred city and language.
- `prayertime help`: Show the help message.

## Configuration

The first time you run the application, it will prompt you to select a city (**english** is the default language). These
settings will be saved for future use.

You can change the _**city**_ or the **_language_** anytime using the `setup` command.

> **NOTE:** If you choose to use the Arabic language option with this package, make sure to check the following:
>
> 1. **Terminal Encoding**: Ensure that your terminal is configured to use UTF-8 or another encoding that supports
     Arabic characters. In some terminals or IDEs (like PyCharm), you may need to set the encoding explicitly.
>
> 2. **Font Support**: Verify that your system has fonts installed that support the display of Arabic characters.
     Without proper font support, Arabic text may not render correctly.
