# Moroccan Prayer Times CLI

A command-line interface (CLI) application to fetch and display Moroccan prayer times for the current day or the next
prayer time remaining, using data provided by the official Moroccan Ministry of Habous and Islamic Affairs
website (https://habous.gov.ma/).

## Features

- Show the time remaining until the next prayer
- Configure the preferred city and language
- Caching of fetched prayer times for better performance
- Localization support for Arabic, English, and French languages

## Installation

You can install the package from PyPI using pip:

```shell
pip install moroccan-prayer-times
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the CLI application with the following commands:

```shell

```

This will display the list of available commands and their descriptions.

### Commands

- `prayer-times today`: Display today's prayer times for the configured city.
- `prayer-times next`: Show the time remaining until the next prayer.
- `prayer-times config`: Display the current configuration (city and language).
- `prayer-times setup`: Configure the preferred city and language.
- `prayer-times help`: Show the help message.

## Configuration

The first time you run the application, it will prompt you to select a city (**english** is the default language). These
settings will be saved for future use.

You can change the city or the language anytime using the `setup` command.
