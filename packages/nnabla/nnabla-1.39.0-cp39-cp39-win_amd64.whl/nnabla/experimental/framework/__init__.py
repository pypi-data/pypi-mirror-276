The three pillars of machine learning are: data, algorithm, and computing power.
The three classes defined in this file are designed to aim at each of them.
Data is for all works related to dataset preparation, including downloading, sampling, generation, etc.
Worker is for all works related to model designing, including training configuration, solver definitions, loss definitions, etc.
Trainer is a standardized common training process.
If we want to provide computing power service in the future, we can work on this trainer without interrupting customer's data or algorithm.
