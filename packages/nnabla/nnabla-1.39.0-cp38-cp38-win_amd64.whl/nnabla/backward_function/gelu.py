    Args:
      grad_inputs (list of :obj:`nnabla.Variable`): Propagated grads to this backward function.
      inputs (list of :obj:`nnabla.Variable` and None): Input Variables of the forward function
          if this backward function depends on it. Otherwise, None is set instead.
      input_shapes (list of tuple of :obj:`int`): Input shapes of the forward function.
          The shapes of the inputs in which None is set can be passed.
      outputs (list of :obj:`nnabla.Variable` and None): Output Variables of the forward function
          if this backward function depends on it. Otherwise, None is set instead.
      output_shapes (list of tuple of :obj:`int`): Output shapes of the forward function.
          The shapes of the outputs in which None is set can be passed.
      kwargs (dict of arguments): Dictionary of the corresponding function arguments.

    Return:
      list of Variable: Return the gradients wrt inputs of the corresponding function.
