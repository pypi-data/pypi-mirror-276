class Evaluator(object):
    '''
    Evaluator class definition, common for all evaluation process.

    In earlier design of nnabla.experimental.trainers.Evaluator, hidden assumption is each callback on finish handles one evaluator's result.
    The input vroot and callback_on_finish have to be the same in size and order.
    Now, the implementation of traversal is moved into the callback functions implemented in Worker, and values to monitor are also maintained in it.

    Communicator is removed since it is not used. We can add it back to enhance performance in future.

    Evaluator uses methods of Worker or its successors as callback functions.
    Evaluator instance is also declared and called in methods of Worker or its successors.

    Args:
        eval_data_feeder (callable :obj:`object`, function, or lambda): Callback called to get next data for evaluation.
        eval_graph_forward (callable :obj:`object`, function, or lambda): Callback called to do forward on evaluation graphs.
        callback_on_start (callable :obj:`object`, function, lambda, or list of these, optional): Callback called before the evaluator.evalute.
        callback_on_finish (callable :obj:`object`, function, lambda, or list of these, optional): Callback called after the evaluator.evalute.
        val_iter (:obj:`int`, optional): Iterations for evaluation.
