## Background
We have independently developed a graphical user interface of the simulation program using the VPython library 
and the Tkinter library, which visualizes the abstract physical situation, and allows the operator to change 
the parameters and visually output the simulation results and the images of various physical quantities in the 
motion process with time, hoping that the abstraction can be transformed into a concrete method, which is 
convenient for students to carry out exploratory and interactive learning.
