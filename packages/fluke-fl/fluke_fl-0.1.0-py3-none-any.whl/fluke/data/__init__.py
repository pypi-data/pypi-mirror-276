class FastDataLoader:
    """
    A DataLoader-like object for a set of tensors that can be much faster than

    the dataset and calls cat (slow).

    Important:
        This type of data loader does not support the application of different transformations
        to the data at each iteration. If you need to apply different transformations to the data
        at each iteration, you should use the standard PyTorch ``DataLoader``.


    Note:
        This implementation is based on the following discussion:
        https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/dataloader-much-slower-than-manual-batching/27014/6

    Args:
        *tensors (Sequence[torch.Tensor]): tensors to be loaded.
        batch_size (int): batch size.
        shuffle (bool): whether the data should be shuffled.
        percentage (float): the percentage of the data to be used.
        skip_singleton (bool): whether to skip batches with a single element. If you have batchnorm
            layers, you might want to set this to ``True``.
        single_batch (bool): whether to return a single batch at each generator iteration.

    Caution:
        When sampling a percentage of the data (i.e., ``percentage < 1``), the data is sampled at
        each epoch. This means that the data varies at each epoch. If you want to keep the data
        constant across epochs, you should sample the data once and pass the sampled
        data to the :class:`FastDataLoader` and set the ``percentage`` parameter to ``1.0``.

    Attributes:
        tensors (Sequence[torch.Tensor]): Tensors of the dataset. Ideally, the first tensor should
            be the input data, and the second tensor should be the labels. However, this is not
            enforced and the user is responsible for ensuring that the tensors are used correctly.
        batch_size (int): batch size.
        shuffle (bool): whether the data should be shuffled at each epoch. If ``True``, the data is
            shuffled at each iteration.
        percentage (float): the percentage of the data to be used. If `1.0`, all the data is used.
            Otherwise, the data is sampled according to the given percentage. **Note that the
            sampled data varies at each epoch.**
        skip_singleton (bool): whether to skip batches with a single element. If you have batchnorm
            layers, you might want to set this to ``True``.
        single_batch (bool): whether to return a single batch at each generator iteration.
        size (int): the size of the dataset according to the percentage of the data to be used.
        max_size (int): the total size of the dataset.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: if the tensors do not have the same size along the first dimension.
