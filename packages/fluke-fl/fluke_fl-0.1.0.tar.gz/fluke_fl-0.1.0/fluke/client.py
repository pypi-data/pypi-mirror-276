class Client():
    """Base ``Client`` class. This class is the base class for all clients in the ``fluke``.
    The behavior of the client is based on the Federated Averaging algorithm. The default behavior
    of a client includes:

    - Receiving the global model from the server;
    - Training the model locally for a number of epochs using the local training set;
    - Sending the updated local model back to the server;
    - (Optional) Evaluating the model on the local test set.

    Attributes:
        hyper_params (DDict): The hyper-parameters of the client. The default hyper-parameters are:

            - ``loss_fn``: The loss function.
            - ``local_epochs``: The number of local epochs.

            When a new client class inherits from this class, it can add all its hyper-parameters
            to this dictionary.

        train_set (FastDataLoader): The local training set.
        test_set (FastDataLoader): The local test set.
        optimizer_cfg (OptimizerConfigurator): The optimizer configurator. This is used to create
            the optimizer and the learning rate scheduler.
        optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer): The optimizer.
        scheduler (torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler): The learning rate scheduler.
        device (torch.device): The device where the client trains the model. By default, it is the
            device defined in :class:`fluke.GlobalSettings`.

    Attention:
        **The client should not directly call methods of the server**. The communication between the
        client and the server must be done through the :attr:`channel`.

    Caution:
        When inheriting from this class, make sure to put all the specific hyper-parameters in the
        :attr:`hyper_params` attribute. In this way ``fluke`` can properly handle the
        hyper-parameters of the client in the federated learning process.

        For example:

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            class MyClient(Client):
                # We omit the type hints for brevity
