A modern template for your awesome C++ scientific computing software app/library with wrappers for Python. This repository sets up a project for a standalone C++ library and app, that is also wrapped into a Python package using [nanobind](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind) and
[scikit-build-core](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
The package is set up to be publishable at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

## CI

The `.github/workflows` directory contains this projects' continuous integration workflows
for GitHub Actions. 

The `python-package` workflow will automatically install Python dependencies, run tests, 
and lint with a variety of Python versions on pushes.

The `python-publish` workflow will automatically upload this repository to PyPI when a release is created. The user must set a secret `PYPI_API_TOKEN` variable in Github.
