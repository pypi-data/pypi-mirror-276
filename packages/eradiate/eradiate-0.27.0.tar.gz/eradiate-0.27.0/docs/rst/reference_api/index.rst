Eradiate's API reference documentation is generated automatically using Sphinx's
``autodoc`` and ``autosummary`` extensions.

.. note:: In addition to APIs, meant to be public and used both externally
   (by end-users) and internally (by maintainers), this reference manual also
   documents internal entry points (used by maintainers within Eradiate).
   Private components are contained in underscore-prefixed modules. In order to
   become part of the API, they need to be either transferred to a public module
   or exposed in a public module.
