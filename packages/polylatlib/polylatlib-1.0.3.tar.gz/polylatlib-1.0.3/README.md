PolyLatLib
=================
By Rex Greenway

This project aims to allow for the investigation of shapes in the R x R Cartesian Plane and their lattices. This Python library provides the functionality to generate, work with, view, and manipulate polygons in the 2D space and, for applciable shapes, generate the corresponding lattice.

The image above shows three seperate, 5-layer, circular lattices displaying equilateral triangles, squares, and regular hexagons.

Features so far:
----------------
- Basic class structure for Polygons.
- Methods to generate and draw Regular Polygons, with preset regular polygons classes.
- Lattice generation for Equilateral Triangles, Squares, and Hexagons.

To Install:
-----------
You can install the library using `pip`:
```
pip install polylatlib
```
