# Schwab-API-Python 
This is an unofficial python program to access the Schwab api.    
You will need a Schwab developer account [here](https://beta-developer.schwab.com/).

## Quick setup
1. Create a new Schwab individual developer app with callback url "https://127.0.0.1" and wait until the status is "Ready for use", note that "Approved - Pending" will not work.
2. Enable TOS (Thinkorswim) for your Schwab account, it is needed for orders and other api calls.
3. Python version 3.11 or higher is required.     
4. `pip3 install requests websockets`
5. Import the package `import schwabkit`
6. Create a client `schwabkit.Client('Your app key', 'Your app secret')`

## What can this program do?
 - Authenticate and access the api 
 - Functions for all api functions (examples in `demo.py`)
 - Auto "access token" updates (`.update_tokens_auto()`)
 - Stream real-time data (`coming soon`)
 - Automatically start/stop stream (`coming soon`)
 ### TBD 
 - Automatic refresh token updates. (Waiting for Schwab implementation)
 - Customizable stream response handler. (Waiting for Schwab implementation)


## Usage and Design
This python client makes working with the TD/Schwab api easier.    
The idea is to make an easy to understand, organized, and highly-automatic interface for the api.   
Below is a light documentation on how it works, python is pseudocode-esk so if you are confused just read the code and follow the functions. 

### Organization

The root of the client:
 - `main.py` where the main program is run from, contains examples for you to get started with.
 - `tokens.json` contains api tokens as well as dates for when they expire.

The schwabkit folder contains code for main operations:     
 - `api.py` contains functions relating to api calls, requests, and automatic token checker threads.
 - `stream.py` contains functions for streaming data from websockets.
 - `terminal.py` contains a program for making additional terminal windows and printing to the terminal with color.
