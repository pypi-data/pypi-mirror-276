# pyrtz2

Analysis of AFM force curves and images via Python.

Developed at Georgia Institute of Technology

# Installation
pyrtz2 is on PyPI. Install using pip (Python version >= 3.10.0 is required)

```
pip install pyrtz2

You can select the contact point interactively. It will perform fits for approach and dwell parts of the curves using Hertzian and biexponential equations. After downloading the `csv` of fits, you can download those curves in one `pdf` file.

These options are under development:
- Download Images
- Download Experiment
