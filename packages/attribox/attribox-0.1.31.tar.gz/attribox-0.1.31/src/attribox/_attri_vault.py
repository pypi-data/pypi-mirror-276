"""AttriVault implements an alternative to AttriBox without automatic
instantiating. Instead, __get__ returns the class itself. The owning class
is expected to instantiate the class. To aid the owning class, AttriVault
allows for arguments to be passed to the owning class as well as arguments
to the class instantiation process.

For example:


class OwnedClass:
  # just any custom class


class Owner:

  name = AttriVault[OwnedClass](*args, **kwargs)

  @name.CREATE(*args2, **kwargs2)
  def createName(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:  # instance of OwnedClass
    # args and kwargs are passed to the OwnedClass constructor
    # args2 and kwargs2 are passed to the CREATE method
    # The Owner class is free to specify the creation process. By having
    # separate sets of arguments, the OwnedClass may require specific
    # instantiation arguments, while different owners may require
    # different arguments. The owner class is required to specific a
    Â¤ CREATE method with the convenient decorator.
