giotto-ph
=========

``giotto-ph`` is a high-performance implementation of Vietoris–Rips (VR) persistence on the CPU, and is distributed under the GNU AGPLv3 license.
It consists of an improved reimplementation of `Morozov and Nigmetov's "lock-free Ripser" <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3350755.3400244>`_
and in addition makes use of a parallel implementation of the *apparent pairs* optimization used in `Ripser v1.2 <https://github.com/Ripser/ripser>`_.
It also contains an improved reimplementation of `GUDHI's Edge Collapse (EC) algorithm <https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02395227>`_ and offers support
for weighted VR filtrations. See also `Morozov's Ripser fork <https://github.com/mrzv/ripser/tree/lockfree>`_, Nigmetov's
`Oineus library <https://github.com/grey-narn/oineus>`_, and `GUDHI's EC implementation <http://gudhi.gforge.inria.fr/doc/latest/group__edge__collapse.html>`_.

``giotto-ph`` is part of the `Giotto <https://github.com/giotto-ai>`_ family of open-source projects and designed for tight integration with
the `giotto-tda <https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda>`_ and `pyflagser <https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda>`_ libraries.


Project genesis
===============

``giotto-ph`` is the result of a collaborative effort between `L2F SA <https://www.l2f.ch/>`_,
the `Laboratory for Topology and Neuroscience <https://www.epfl.ch/labs/hessbellwald-lab/>`_ at EPFL,
and the `Institute of Reconfigurable & Embedded Digital Systems (REDS) <https://heig-vd.ch/en/research/reds>`_ of HEIG-VD.

``giotto-ph`` is distributed under the AGPLv3 `license <https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.
If you need a different distribution license, please contact the `L2F team`_.


Parallel persistent homology backend
====================================

Computing persistence barcodes of large datasets and in high homology degrees is challenging even on modern hardware. ``giotto-ph``'s persistent homology backend
is able to distribute the key stages of the computation (namely, search for apparent pairs and coboundary matrix reduction) across an arbitrary number of available CPU threads.

On challenging datasets, the scaling is quite favourable as shown in the following figure (for more details, see our paper linked below):

Basic usage in Python
=====================

Basic imports:

.. code-block:: python
    
    import numpy as np
    from gph import ripser_parallel

Point clouds
------------

Persistence diagram of a random point cloud of 100 points in 3D Euclidean space, up to homology dimension 2, using all available threads:

.. code-block:: python

    pc = np.random.random((100, 3))
    dgm = ripser_parallel(pc, maxdim=2, n_threads=-1)

Distance matrices and graphs
----------------------------

You can also work with distance matrices by passing ``metric="precomputed"``:

.. code-block:: python

    from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
    
    # A distance matrix
    dm = squareform(pdist(pc))
    dgm = ripser_parallel(pc, metric="precomputed", maxdim=2, n_threads=-1)

More generally, you can work with dense or sparse adjacency matrices of weighted graphs. Here is a dense square matrix interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a fully connected weighted graph with 100 vertices:

.. code-block:: python

    # Entries can be negative. The only constraint is that, for every i and j, dm[i, j] ≥ max(dm[i, i], dm[j, j])
    # With dense input, the lower diagonal is ignored
    adj_dense = np.random.random((100, 100))
    np.fill_diagonal(adj_dense, 0)
    dgm = ripser_parallel(adj_dense, metric="precomputed", maxdim=2, n_threads=-1)

And here is a sparse adjacency matrix:

.. code-block:: python

    # See API reference for treatment of entries below the diagonal
    from scipy.sparse import random
    adj_sparse = random(100, 100, density=0.1)
    dgm = ripser_parallel(adj_sparse, metric="precomputed", maxdim=2, n_threads=-1)

Edge Collapser
--------------

Push the computation to higher homology dimensions and larger point clouds/distance matrices/adjacency matrices using edge collapses:

.. code-block:: python

    dgm_higher = ripser_parallel(pc, maxdim=5, collapse_edges=True, n_threads=-1)

(Note: not all datasets and configurations will benefit from edge collapses. For more details, see our paper below.)

Weighted Rips Filtrations
-------------------------

Use the ``weights`` and ``weight_params`` parameters to constructed a weighted Rips filtration as defined in `this paper <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43408-3_2>`_. ``weights`` can either be a custom 1D array of vertex weights, or the string ``"DTM"`` for distance-to-measure reweighting:

.. code-block:: python

    dgm_dtm = ripser_parallel(pc, weights="DTM", n_threads=-1)


Documentation and Tutorials
===========================

Jupyter notebook tutorials can be found in the `examples folder <https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-ph/blob/main/examples>`_.

Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

The latest stable version of ``giotto-ph`` requires:

- Python (>= 3.7)
