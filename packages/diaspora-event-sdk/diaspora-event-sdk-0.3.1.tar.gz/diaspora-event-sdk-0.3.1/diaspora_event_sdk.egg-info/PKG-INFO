# Diaspora Event Fabric SDK

## Installation Guide
### Recommended Method: With `kafka-python`
To integrate with Diaspora Event Fabric using `KafkaProducer` and `KafkaConsumer`, install the SDK with `kafka-python`:
```bash
pip install "diaspora-event-sdk[kafka-python]"
```

### Alternative Installation: Without Kafka Client Library
For other Kafka client libraries (e.g., `confluent-kafka-python`, `aiokafka`), install the SDK without `kafka-python`:
```bash
pip install diaspora-event-sdk
```
Note: This does not include `KafkaProducer` and `KafkaConsumer` dependencies.
