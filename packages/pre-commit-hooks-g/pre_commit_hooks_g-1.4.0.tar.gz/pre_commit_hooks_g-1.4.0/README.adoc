= Pre-Commit Hooks for G

This is the repository for holding the pre-commit hooks for G code (LabVIEW).

The code was developed over the pre-commit platform in python and uses G-CLI to call labview.

== Usage

Setup and usage of pre-commit hooks are well documented in link:https://pre-commit.com/#usage[Pre-Commit website].

Each hook has its own configuration and that is detailed down below in the available hooks section.

The main tool has some options that can be used as arguments in each of the hooks. Use this with caution, as this is not a global configuration, and can cause undesired effects running on multiple hooks at once.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Argument |description

|--allow-dialogs
|Allow dialogs option from G-CLI. Check G-CLI documentation.

|--debug
|Enables debugging of the hook wrapper, it does not close the VI after running.

|--hook-args and \--
|It is possible to forward args to the hooks. Use this as your last argument and the arguments to the hook as items in the list. Include a \-- at the end to split from the wrapper arguments. Arguments need to use a different leading notation, not - or \--, as they are recognized as python argparse arguments.

== Available Hooks

The available hooks are mainly listed in the .pre-commit-hooks.yaml.

Here is a small description on the ones available now. For supported file types you may check the .pre-commit-hooks.yaml file.

See example file on how to setup, see link:docs/.pre-commit-config-example.yaml[Config Example]

=== Close LabVIEW

Simple hook to close LabVIEW before starting the other processes. It can be useful for making sure everything is closed in memory.

=== VI Broken

Check if VI/file is in executable state. You may skip using a bookmark "#vi-broken skip". Useful for FPGA VIs for example.

=== VI Description

Check if there is a VI description.

=== Remove Mutation History

Remove mutation history from classes (lvclass) if they are present.

=== Separate Compiled Code from Source

Set to separate compiled code from source in VI, VIM, CTL, LVCLASS, LVLIB.

In projects, it sets to separate compiled from source in new items.

=== Check Missing Items

In projects, lvlibs and lvclass it checks if one of those have missing items. It will fail if it finds missing items.

=== VI Version

Verify if the VI version matches the argument.

To add argument, modify hooks configuration to: 

[source,yaml]
----
    - id: vi-version
      args: [--hook-args, /version, "17.0", --]
----

Replace by the LabVIEW Version you need.

Don't forget trailing dashes (--). This makes python to ignore and forward this part to G-CLI.

In case no argument is provided, the hook is no-op.

=== Discard No Changes

EXPERIMENTAL. It tests if the VI is equal in matter of LVCompare. This means although they differ in git, they do not have a difference.

The Hook will unstage the file using git, so users can evaluate themselves if the equal comparison is valid.

Known issues with visibility of node in structures, i.e. hidden iteration terminal in a loop. LVCompare shows them both as equal.

Use LVCompare afterwards to make sure the VI is the same before totally discarding the changes.

=== Yellow - G Code formatter

Format the VIs with the current steps (Some steps were borrowed from the Nattify, QD Enthushiasts).
None of the steps are configurable, not even by INI entries. Name is a reference to the Black, which is a opinionated formatter for Python.
As this hook modifies code, it needs to resave the file and you will be required to stage the new version again to commit. With the new LabVIEW feature to save for previous, this hook will try to keep the VI Save version as it is, if it detects the Save version is different from the VI version.

* Arrange Windows - you may skip front panel arrangement with the bookmark '#yellow skip-fp'
* Terminal as Icons - icon view is false
* Auto Error Handling - turn off auto error handling
* Separate Compiled Code from Source - set flag to keep source only
* Auto Grow in Structures - set auto grow off in block diagram structures
* Move Labels - in BD move control labels to left and indicators to right
* Front Panel Color - changes the front panel color to LabVIEW defaults (can be skipped with bookmark '#yellow skip-fp')

== Design

Because there is no support for direct G calls in the pre-commits, it was decided to create a python wrapper that will call the labview hooks using G-CLI.

The hooks were simplified with a LabVIEW Wrapper, so they do not need to handle all arguments received by the Pre-Commit framework.

Instead it just receive a cluster with the required data.

The Python code handles arguments and calling the G-CLI for the specific hook

The coded iterates over the different files in one call, avoiding performance issues by calling the hook wrapper many times.

== Contributing

You can decide to create new hooks or contribute with the python code.

Either way, make sure to install pre-commit.

=== Python Code

Uses at least Python 3.11, as it was not tested with other versions (to do).
Requirementes:

* Python 3.11
* Poetry

To run it use:

* `make setup` - Setup

* `make tests` - Test

* `make format` - Code formatting

* `make all` - Format and test

=== Developing new hooks

New hooks can be developed following the template in docs/hook-template.vit.

Make sure you close the VI reference if you open it.

Create tests accordingly for each of the supported files types and eventually VI types.

Fork, modify the code and submit a merge request back.

=== External hooks

External hooks are not supported yet, although it is under investigation.

This means if you want to develop your own hook you need to submit a MR or create a hook in your own fork.

== Dependencies

- G-CLI
- Caraya Unit Test Framework
- Python 3.11 and Poetry
