# Learn Koheesio

Koheesio is designed to simplify the development of data engineering pipelines. It provides a structured way to define and execute data processing tasks, making it easier to build, test, and maintain complex data workflows.

## Core Concepts

Koheesio is built around several core concepts:

- **Step**: The fundamental unit of work in Koheesio. It represents a single operation in a data pipeline, taking in inputs and producing outputs.
- **Task**: A larger unit of work, typically encompassing an entire Extract - Transform - Load process for a data object.
- **Context**: A configuration class used to set up the environment for a Task. It can be used to share variables across tasks and adapt the behavior of a Task based on its environment.
- **Logger**: A class for logging messages at different levels.
- **Reader**: A type of Step that reads data from a source and stores the result (to make it available for subsequent steps).
- **Writer**: This controls how data is written to the output in both batch and streaming contexts.
- **Transformation**: A type of Step that takes a DataFrame as input and returns a DataFrame as output.

In any given pipeline, you can expect to use Readers, Writers, and Transformations to express the ETL logic. Readers are responsible for extracting data from various sources, such as databases, files, or APIs. Transformations then process this data, performing operations like filtering, aggregation, or conversion. Finally, Writers handle the loading of the transformed data to the desired destination, which could be a database, a file, or a data stream. The Logger and Context classes provide support for these operations, enabling detailed logging of the pipeline's execution and customization of the pipeline's behavior based on the environment, respectively. The Task class ties these components together, orchestrating the execution of the Steps in a pipeline.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to define and execute a Step:

```python
from koheesio import Step

class MyStep(Step):
    def execute(self):
        # Your step logic here

step = MyStep()
step.execute()
```

## Advanced Usage

For more advanced usage, check out the examples in the [`__notebooks__`]("__notebooks__") directory of the Koheesio repository. 
These examples show how to use Koheesio's features in more detail.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices for using Koheesio:

1. **Use Context**: The `Context` class in Koheesio is designed to behave like a dictionary, but with added features. 
     It's a good practice to use `Context` to customize the behavior of a task. This allows you to share variables
     across tasks and adapt the behavior of a task based on its environment; for example, by changing the source or
     target of the data between development and production environments.

2. **Modular Design**: Each step in the pipeline (reading, transformation, writing) should be encapsulated in its own
     class, making the code easier to understand and maintain. This also promotes re-usability as steps can be reused
     across different tasks.

3. **Error Handling**: Koheesio provides a consistent way to handle errors and exceptions in data processing tasks. Make
     sure to leverage this feature to make your pipelines robust and fault-tolerant.

4. **Logging**: Use the built-in logging feature in Koheesio to log information and errors in data processing tasks.
     This can be very helpful for debugging and monitoring the pipeline. Koheesio sets the log level to `WARNING` by
     default, but you can change it to `INFO` or `DEBUG` as needed.

5. **Testing**: Each step can be tested independently, making it easier to write unit tests. It's a good practice to
     write tests for your steps to ensure they are working as expected.

6. **Use Transformations**: The `Transform` class in Koheesio allows you to define transformations on your data. It's a
     good practice to encapsulate your transformation logic in `Transform` classes for better readability and
     maintainability.

7. **Consistent Structure**: Koheesio enforces a consistent structure for data processing tasks. Stick to this structure
     to make your codebase easier to understand for new developers.

8. **Use Readers and Writers**: Use the built-in `Reader` and `Writer` classes in Koheesio to handle data extraction
     and loading. This not only simplifies your code but also makes it more robust and efficient.

Remember, these are general best practices and might need to be adapted based on your specific use case and
requirements.
