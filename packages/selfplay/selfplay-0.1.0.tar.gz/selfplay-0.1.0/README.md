## Usage
### Example 1: Multi-turn Self Chat

In this example, the chatbot will perform a self-chat to simulate a conversation with itself. This can be useful for improving response accuracy and testing conversational flows.
```python
import os
from selfplay.chatbot import Chatbot

# Set OpenAI credentials
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "8jsd899fs000sdf7632"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT"] = "https://server.openai.azure.com"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2023-12-01-preview"

#self-chat multi-turn conversation
bot = Chatbot(name="default", sys_msg="you are a helpful assistant and honest in repsones. you give short and concise response.")
bot.chat("what is the capital of California")    
bot.chat("how about Oregon?")
bot.chat("How many live here?")
print(bot)
```
### Example 2: Chat with Another Bot

In this example, two chatbots, one acting as a teacher and the other as a student, interact with each other. This showcases how you can simulate educational or customer service interactions.

```python
import os
from selfplay.chatbot import Chatbot

# Set OpenAI credentials
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "8jsd899fs000sdf7632"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT"] = "https://server.openai.azure.com"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2023-12-01-preview"

# Initialize chatbots with specific roles and system messages
teacher = Chatbot(
    name="Teacher",
    sys_msg="You are a helpful teacher with extensive knowledge of science and math. "
            "You ask thoughtful questions to motivate and invoke students' curiosity and depth. "
            "Provide concise, crisp, and clear replies."
)
student = Chatbot(
    name="Student",
    sys_msg="You are a student trying to learn from a teacher. "
            "Ask clarifying questions until the topic is clear to you."
)

#Interact between the teacher and student chatbots
response = teacher.interact(
    student,  #who to interact with
    start="I'm a 4th grader and I don't seem to quite understand what complex numbers are.",
    num_turns=2,  #max_turns in conversation
    filename="/Users/dpiskala/Downloads/teacher-student.html"  #export the chat results in a well-formatted html file.
)
print(response)
```
