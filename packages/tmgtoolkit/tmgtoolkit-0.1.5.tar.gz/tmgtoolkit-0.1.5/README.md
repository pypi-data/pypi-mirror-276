# TMG Toolkit

Utilities for time-series analysis of tensiomyography (TMG) measurement data.

Features include:

- Extract TMG measurements from a standard TMG Excel file format.
- Compute the standard TMG parameters `Dm`, `Td`, `Tc`, `Ts`, and `Tr` of a time series signal.
- Compute the derivative of a time series signal.
- Find accurate extremum values and times of a time series signal using polynomial interpolation.
- Perform statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis of time series signals.
- Plot time series signals and the results of SPM analysis.
