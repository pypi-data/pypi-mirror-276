## Overview
The Protein Analysis Package is a Python package designed to perform various analyses on DNA and their respective protein sequences. The package includes functions to convert DNA sequences into protein sequences by evaluating all possible frames of DNA. It is also able to analyse the protein sequences and calculate the hydrophobicity score, molecular weight, likelihood of secondary structure configurations (beta-sheet, alpha-helix, and beta-turn), and the retention coefficient in High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) based on the amino acid sequences.

## Features

- Start sequence identification: Identify start sequence (ex: Shine Dalgarno) among a long sequence of DNA and give all possible protein convertible sections.
- DNA to Protein conversion: Convert the DNA into the protein sequences using different reading frames.
- Hydrophobicity Score Calculation: Compute the hydrophobicity score of a protein sequence using Kyte & Doolittle's scale.
- Molecular Weight Calculation: Determine the molecular weight of a protein sequence based on the molecular weights of individual amino acids.
- Secondary Structure Likelihood Calculation: Evaluate the likelihood of a protein sequence forming beta-sheets, alpha-helices, or beta-turn using the Chou and Fasman techniques
- HPLC Retention Coefficient Calculation: Calculate the retention coefficient of a protein sequence in HPLC using given retention values for amino acids.
- Polarity evaluation: Polarity score calculation based on the Zimmerman scale.
- Summarize data into Excel file: All previously calculated data is summarized into an excel sheet.
 
## Installation

```
pip install DNAPROT
```

The package uses the following dependencies:

- Pandas (2.2.2)

- Openpyxl (3.1.3)

## Usage

Attention: for the transcription functions to work, a file containing the genetic code file must be in the same repo as the script. One can use the file provided alongside this package or use a different code for other genetic codes (ex: mitochondrial DNA code, etc...)

A very basic usage for our package would be to generate the protein sequence and properties from a large .fasta file containing the DNA sequence.

Start by importing the package and reading the start sequence. Create different sections from the generated "output.txt" file and then analyse it using the "DNA_ToProtExcl_Analysis" function.

```python

import DNAPROT_analysis as DNAPROT

ReadShineDalgarnoFromFasta('sequence.fasta')
sections = separate_sections('output.txt')
DNA_ToProtExcl_Analysis(sections, section_number=None, output_folder=None)

```
