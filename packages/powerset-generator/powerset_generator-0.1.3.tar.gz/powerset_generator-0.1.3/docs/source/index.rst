A Python Generator of power sets
==============================================

This is documentatation for version |version| of |project| package,
a simply python package for creating power sets of a collection.

Installation
------------

To use powerset generator, first install it with `pip`

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install powerset-generator

Example
-------

The root (and so far only) module is |root|,
providing the only function, :func:`subsets`.

.. code-block:: python

   from powerset_generator import subsets
   for e in subsets( ["one", "two", "three", "three"])]:
      print(e)

should produce a result *similar to*

.. code-block:: python

   set()
   {'one'}
   {'three'}
   {'two'}
   {'one', 'three'}
   {'one', 'two'}
   {'three', 'two'}
   {'one', 'three', 'two'}

.. note::

   1. The empty set, ``set()``, is included in the output;

   2. The full set ``{'one', 'two', 'three'}`` is included in the output;

   3. The duplicated input element ``"three"`` is treated as if it appeared only once;
   
   4. The order in which the subsets are generated is not defined.
