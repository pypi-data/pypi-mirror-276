# TextEmbed - Embedding Inference Server

TextEmbed is a high-throughput, low-latency REST API designed for serving vector embeddings. It supports a wide range of sentence-transformer models and frameworks, making it suitable for various applications in natural language processing.

## Features

- **High Throughput & Low Latency:** Designed to handle a large number of requests efficiently.
- **Flexible Model Support:** Works with various sentence-transformer models.
- **Scalable:** Easily integrates into larger systems and scales with demand.
- **Batch Processing:** Supports batch processing for better and faster inference.
- **OpenAI Compatible REST API Endpoint:** Provides an OpenAI compatible REST API endpoint.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed. You will also need to install the required dependencies.

### Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -U textembed
    ```

2. Start the TextEmbed server with your desired model:
    ```bash
    python3 -m textembed.server --model <Model Name>
    ```

    Replace `<Model Name>` with the name of the model you want to use.

3. For more information and additional options, run:
    ```bash
    python3 -m textembed.server --help
    ```

### Running with Docker (Recommended)
You can also run TextEmbed using Docker. The Docker image is available on Docker Hub.
```bash
docker run kevaldekivadiya/textembed:latest --help
```
This command will show the help message for the TextEmbed server, detailing the available options and usage.

For Example:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 kevaldekivadiya/textembed:latest --model sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 --port 8000
```

### Accessing the API

Once the server is running, you can access the API documentation via Swagger UI.
