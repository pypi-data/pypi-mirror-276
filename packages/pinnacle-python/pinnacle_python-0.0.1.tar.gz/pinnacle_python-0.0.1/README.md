# Pinnacle Python Client
This is the official Python client for the Pinnacle Serverless Backend API. 

## Pre-requisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

## Using Poetry
Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.
- Run `poetry install` to install the dependencies from the `pyproject.toml` file.
- Run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment.

## Local Development
- Run `poetry install` to install the local pinnacle_python client package.
- Import `pinnacle_python` in your Python code and start using the client.
