## Overview

Vectorvision is a tool for vectorizing raster graphics, written on the basis of the potrace (https://potrace.sourceforge.net/) program. A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in the publication about potrace (https://potrace.sourceforge.net/potrace.pdf).
For now, available color formats are binary and grayscale, RGB images are firstly converted to grayscale and vectorized. You can convert images of any common format including: png, jpg, jpeg. The output format is SVG.

## Features

The program allows you to transfer images from raster formats, e.g. PNG, to the SVG vector format. The program is available from the command line.
Features:
- Support for utility formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP.
- Output format: SVG.
- Optimization of the SVG output file for functionality.
- Starting the program from the command line.

## Tech Stack

The language of this project is Python. These are main libraries that we use:
- Sphinx
- PIL
- numpy
- shapely
- pytest
