# This file contains pip version constraints that arise due to security concerns.
# This allows us to specify security-safe versions of packages even if the
# packages are not direct dependencies for us.
#
# Security constraints for direct dependencies should go in the appropriate `.in`
# file (or constraints-direct.txt) with an appropriate note.
#
# This file must use the > or >= operators to specify lower version constraints. This
# file must not contain upper version constraints (e.g. <= or <).
