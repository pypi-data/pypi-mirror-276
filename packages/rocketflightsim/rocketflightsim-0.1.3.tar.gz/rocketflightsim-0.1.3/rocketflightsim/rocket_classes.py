    The Motor class is used to store the properties of a rocket motor. The properties are:

    - thrust_curve: dictionary of thrust (N) at time (s after ignition)
    - total_impulse: total impulse of the motor (Ns)
    - burn_time: time it takes for the motor to burn all of its fuel (s)
    - fuel_mass_curve: dictionary of mass (kg) at time (s after ignition)
    - fuel_mass: total mass of fuel in the motor before ignition (kg)

    If fuel_mass_curve is not provided but feul_mass is, fuel_mass_curve is calculated from the thrust_curve and fuel_mass (assuming fuel burn is proportional to thrust). If fuel_mass_curve is provided, fuel_mass is set to the initial mass in fuel_mass_curve. If neither are provided, fuel_mass and fuel_mass_curve are set to 0.

""" TODO Adding wind to the simulation

For first implementation:
- wind will only act in directions parallel to the ground
- wind will have a constant speed and direction for the entire flight
- wind will only affect the rocket's relative airspeed
    - lateral forces will not be considered
- wind will not affect flight from ignition to launch rail clearance
- at launch rail clearance, the rocket will instantly have the wind's velocity added to its velocity vector (instantly weathercock the rocket, keeping the 0 angle of attack assumption used in the simulator)


In the simulation, need to add the wind speed to the rocket's velocity vector and have that relative airspeed vector used to determine the drag force and the rocket's angle of attack (but not the rocket's displacement, which should still be calculated using the rocket's velocity vector).

Use this to get data for Spaceport America for the example configuration: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/swi7jrl14evqmap/AADW6GMVIv87KkOBY1-flsoIa?e=1
    Note that time is in UTC 
    Also use it to add to the Prometheus launch conditions in the airbrakes repo
    Remember that launches can't happen if wind > 20mph, so don't consider data with wind speeds above that when trying to find an average

Is it worth describing the wind as None when not specified and having the simulator run faster by not having to add the wind speed to the velocity vector if it's None? 

Could be added later:    
Varying wind speed and direction with altitude or time, gusts, etc
    - varying_wind_speed: list of tuples
        - Each tuple contains the time (s after ignition) and the wind speed (m/s) at that time. Wind speed is relative to the ground.
    - varying_wind_direction: list of tuples
        - Each tuple contains the time (s after ignition) and the direction of the wind (deg). 0 is a headwind, 90 is a crosswind from the right, 180 is a tailwind, 270 is a crosswind from the left.
    - wind_gusts: list of tuples
        - Each tuple contains the time (s after ignition) and the wind speed (m/s) at that time. Wind speed is relative to the ground.
