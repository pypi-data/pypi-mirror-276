    The Motor class is used to store the properties of a rocket motor. The properties are:

    - dry_mass: mass of the motor without fuel (kg)
    - thrust_curve: dictionary of thrust (N) at time (s after ignition)
    - total_impulse: total impulse of the motor (Ns)
    - burn_time: time it takes for the motor to burn all of its fuel (s)
    - fuel_mass_curve: dictionary of mass (kg) at time (s after ignition)
    - fuel_mass: total mass of fuel in the motor before ignition (kg)

    If fuel_mass_curve is not provided but feul_mass is, fuel_mass_curve is calculated from the thrust_curve and fuel_mass (assuming fuel burn is proportional to thrust). If fuel_mass_curve is provided, fuel_mass is set to the initial mass in fuel_mass_curve. If neither are provided, fuel_mass and fuel_mass_curve are set to 0.

        The rocket's motor.
    A_rocket : float
        Cross-sectional area of the rocket (m^2) used when Cd_rocket_at_Ma was calculated.
    Cd_rocket_at_Ma : float or function
        Coefficient of drag of the rocket. May be given as a function of Mach number or as a constant.
    h_second_rail_button : float
        Height of the second rail button from the bottom of the rocket (m). This is the upper button if there are only 2.
    dry_mass : float
        Total mass of the rocket without fuel (kg).

        Coefficient of drag of the rocket multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the rocket (m^2).
