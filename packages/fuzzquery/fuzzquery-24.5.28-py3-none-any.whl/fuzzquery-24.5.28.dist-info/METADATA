.. code-block:: python

  import fuzzquery as fq

  data = """ 
  I would classify music as one of my favorite hobbies. 
  I love classical music played by classy musicians for a classic musical. 
  Beethoven can not be out-classed, music-wise - a man of class, musically gifted.
  """
  query = 'class{4} music{5}'
  
  print(f'\n{query.upper()} using skip')
  for span, match in fq.finditer(data, query, skip=('classify', ','), ci=True):
      print(f'  {match}')
      
  print(f'\n{query.upper()} no skip')
  for span, match in fq.finditer(data, query, ci=True):
      print(f'  {match}')
