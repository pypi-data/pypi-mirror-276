# MODEL AGNOSTIC SAFE AI

This package is based on [safeaipackage](https://pypi.org/project/safeaipackage/). The main difference between these two packages is the input required by the functions. In safeaipackage there are different function which ask for train\test data and a machine learning model. Then, all the process of the training and evaluation is done inside the function. However, in modelagnosticsafeaipackage, it is only needed to provide the actual values (y) and the predicted values by any model you are interested in. Hence, while safeaipackage only works with scikit-learn models, here you can use your model in interest to find the estimated values and then use this package to evaluate risks of your model.
