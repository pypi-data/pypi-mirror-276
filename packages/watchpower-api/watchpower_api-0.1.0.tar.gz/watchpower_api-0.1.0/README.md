# WatchPower API in Python

By using Jadx and decompiling the WatchPower Android APK, I reverse-engineered its authentication process to have direct access to the backend's Rest-API. This way, we can programmatically query inverter data. I've made this available through a Python package in pip:

```shell
pip install watchpower-api
```
