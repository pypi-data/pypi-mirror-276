 pySunSpec Release Notes
========================

Version 1.0.4   21 Jun 2014
---------------------------
- Updated to not read point values of all models on client device creation. Model point values need to be read explicitly after creation either at the device or model level. Speeds up device creation/scan significantly for devices with multiple models.
- Updated connection usage for device scan for Modbus TCP devices.
- Augmented mbmap functionality.
- Augmented SunSpec data record functionality.
- Corrected uninitialized point type variable when processing model types.
- Added support for count and uint64 types.
- Added unit test to read all smdx model files in the model directory.

--- Include latest SMDX model definitions which have been updated with the following changes:
- Common model documentation typo (fix the description for Opt and Vr to correct length of 16 chars)
- Update SC and MPPT models to use "count".
- Changed the 'N' attribute to be of type count. (This does not effect device implementations, clients may treat 'count' as uint16)
- Corrected model name attributes in model 201 and model 306.

Version 1.0.5   7 Apr 2015
---------------------------
- Corrected curve example in documentation.
- Added SMDX symbol support.
- Updated setting of point base value based on type.
- Updated client interface type strings.
- Updated ModbusMap to support 'mapid' attribute.
- Corrected suns integer and long conversion to handle non-string arguments.
- Added support for eui48 (MAC) SunSpec type.

--- Include latest SMDX model definitions which have been updated with the following changes:
- Corrected MAC address point in model 11.
- Added storage models 801, 802, 803.

Version 1.0.6   4 Jun 2015
---------------------------
- Corrected support for constant scale factor.
- Updated to observe point address boundry on model read.

--- Include latest SMDX model definitions which have been updated with the following changes:
- Model 63001 - Added constant scale factor point and label info.
- Model 63002 - Added label info.

Version 1.0.7 8 Feb 2016
------------------------
- Correct client initialization error handling to close underlying device.

--- Include latest SMDX model definitions which have been updated with the following changes:
- Corrected acc32 to float32 in models 211, 212, 213, 214.
- Removed scale factor definition from DeptRef definition in model 126.

Version 1.0.8 20 Jul 2016
-------------------------
- Corrected scan for Modbus address 0 (issue #11).

--- Include latest SMDX model definitions which have been updated with the following changes:
- Corrected model length to the convention of fixed block + one repeating block.
- Corrected units for model 121 WGra to be per second rather per minute to be consistent with previous correction to IEC 61850-7-420.
- Updated models 801-809

Version 2.0.0 11 Feb 2018
-------------------------
- Updated to support Python 3. Updated version officially supports 2.7, 3.3-3.6.
- Include latest SMDX model definitions.
