# _Chart Me_ Charting that keeps you in the EDA flow

---

Chart Me is a high-level charting library designed to expedite the Exploratory Data Analysis Process(eda). There are a few automated eda tools like [sweet viz](https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/) that give a great initial set of visualizations. [lux](https://github.com/lux-org/lux) is a great tool to leverage - which gives a feel of AI assistance - but not always on the mark. The other alternative is hand-writing Altair code, which takes me out of the EDA flow looking up syntax or building functions..._Chart Me_ serves to keep you in the data analytics flow of discovery by keeping visualization commands to **one function** to remember.

## Chart Me Documentation

See [Read the Docs](https://chart-me.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more details

## **Usage Warnings**

Currently a proof-of-concept mode at this time. Limited to univariate & bivariate charts and doesn't support geographical data and is lightly tested.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install chart-me
```

## Simple Usage

`chart_me` to quickly generate visualizations during eda process

```python
import chart_me as ce
ce.chart_me(df, 'col_1', 'col_2') #<-- reads as c-e-chart_me

```
