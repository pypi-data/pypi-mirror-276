    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Chromatography is a crucial analytical method in chemistry used for separating, identifying, and quantifying components in a mixture. Selecting the appropriate type of chromatography (e.g., gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, ion chromatography, size exclusion chromatography) is essential for optimal results. This is why we decided to <b>create a programming tool that allows to determine easily the chromatpgraphy type as well as the best eluent and conditions needed to carry out the chromatography</b>. <br>\n",
    "This report details the development and execution of a programming project aimed at creating a tool to determine the most suitable chromatography technique for analyzing a given mixture of molecules. The project was conducted using python 3.10. The <b> different functions created to make this tool are listed </b> in this notebook. <br>\n",
    "To carry out this project, PubChem has been used as a data base in order to extract all the important information that were needed to establish the best chromatography type (boiling_point, pka, LogP, Molar Weight). Then, a function that takes into account all the different information contained in a dataframe has been created and finaly, a user interface has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project was to develop a program that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine physicochemical properties from PubChem input data on the molecular composition of a mixture.\n",
    "- Store the properties\n",
    "- Recommends the most suitable chromatography technique based on predefined criteria and standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **References**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pubchemprops: <b>Github repo of mawansui </b> (https://github.com/mawansui/pubchemprops) used to retrieve most of the properties of the molecules from Pubchem\n",
    "- pka_lookup.py: <b>Github repo of Khoivan88 </b> (https://github.com/khoivan88/pka_lookup) which request the needed dictionnary of pka on PubChem.\n",

The user can give molecule names that will be added to a listbox to keep in mind the different molecules in the mixture.

If an error occurs, an error message will be displayed using a message box on the user interface."

    "The project successfully developed a robust program for recommending chromatography techniques based on molecular composition. The use of a user interface facilitated an efficient and interactive development process, enabling easy experimentation and visualization. This tool has significant potential applications in chemical analysis, improving efficiency and accuracy in selecting the appropriate analytical methods. The main goal is to generate a database with commun eluants and their Boiling_point, pka, thermal stability. The last property needs to be researched in laboratory.\n",

    "\n",
    "Future enhancements could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expanding the dataset to cover more diverse molecular structures and additional chromatography techniques.\n",
    "- Improve the code to have a more efficient way to take the information on the molecules contained in the mixture to have the results more rapidly.\n",
    "- Integrating the program with real-time data acquisition systems for automated analysis.\n",
    "- Enhancing the user interface with more sophisticated visualization tools and user-friendly features.\n",
    "- By continuing to refine and expand this tool, it can establish itself as a valuable resource for chemists and researchers in analytical laboratories.\n",
