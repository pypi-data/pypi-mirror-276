Graphical user interface
========================


For cases where the other usage options do not appear to be convenient, a `graphical user interface <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface>`_ (GUI) is available. This type of interface allows for interact with the software through graphical icons and menus instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

This interface is still experimental and not actively maintained. It should work on most systems and provide access to all main functions. For more information please refer to the `installation instructions <installation-gui.html>`_. If installation fails, usage on the command-line is recommended.
