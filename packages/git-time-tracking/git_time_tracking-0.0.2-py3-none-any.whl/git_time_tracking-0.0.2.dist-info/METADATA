# Git Time Tracking

This is a tool, allowing you to view the commits you have made in a set of repositories. This is useful if you need to write down your times for work.

## Installation

You can install the program by using pip:

```bash
pip install git-time-tracking
```

> Make sure nano is installed on your system, as it is used for editing the config file.

## Usage

You can see all the cli options by running:

```bash
git_time_tracking --help
```

The first time running the program, you will be thrown into `nano` (has to be installed). Here you can specify the repositories you want to track, and some other settings.
