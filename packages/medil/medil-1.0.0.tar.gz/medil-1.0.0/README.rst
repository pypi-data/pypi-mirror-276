MeDIL
=====

MeDIL is a Python package for causal factor analysis, using the
measurement dependence inducing latent (MeDIL) causal model
framework\ `1 <#uai_paper>`__. In addition to simple linear Gaussian
models, MeDIL also supports deep generative models\ `2 <#ncfa_paper>`__.

More information can be found in the
`documentation <https://medil.causal.dev>`__.
