This is a Python re-write of the CSIRO seawater toolbox
([SEAWATER-3.3](https://www.cmar.csiro.au/datacentre/ext_docs/seawater.html))
for calculating the properties of sea water. The package uses the
formulas from Unesco's joint panel on oceanographic tables and
standards, UNESCO 1981 and UNESCO 1983 (EOS-80).

The EOS-80 library is considered now obsolete; it is provided here for
compatibility with old scripts, and to allow a smooth transition to the
new [TEOS-10](https://www.teos-10.org/).

## Warning

The Python version default output unit for sw.dist is *km* instead of
*nm*.

Here we assume pressure as the first dimension, i.e. M pressure by N
positions (See the table below). The Matlab version does some guessing
at this that we simply ignore to avoid confusions.

The current version was tested against the Matlab seawater v3.3
reproducing all functions and results from that release.
