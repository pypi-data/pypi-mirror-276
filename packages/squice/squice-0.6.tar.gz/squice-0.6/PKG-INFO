# SQUICE

*Slicing through squares: visualise and interpolate numerical matrix data.*

This is a python library with accompanying demonstration streamlit web application, to visualise and interpolate numerical matrix data.

This github site, streamlit application and pypi library has been created from the scientific application template [app-lib-py](https://github.com/RachelAlcraft/app-lib-py).

### Use as an application
To use the application simply go to the open source publicly hosted for free application [squice@streamlit](https://squice.streamlit.app/)

### Use as a python library
```
pip install squice
```
The documentation for the library is here: [squice docs](https://rachelalcraft.github.io/squice/index.html).
Note the application [squice@streamlit](https://squice.streamlit.app/) also shows demonstrations of how to use the library.


### Use as a self-hosted web app
This can also be [downloaded from docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/raea/squice/general) and self-hosted.
