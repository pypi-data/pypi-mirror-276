# Unthermal

Unthermal is a Python package designed to facilitate the learning and understanding of control systems. This package provides a suite of tools and examples that help students and educators simulate and analyze various control system dynamics and responses.

## Features

- **Simulation Tools**: Simulate the behavior of various control systems under different conditions.
- **Analysis Utilities**: Analyze stability, frequency response, and other key metrics of control systems.
- **Interactive Examples**: Hands-on, interactive examples to aid in understanding complex concepts.
- **Educational Materials**: Access to tutorials and guides for using the package in educational settings.

## Installation

You can install `unthermal` directly using pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install unthermal
\`\`\`

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a quick example to get you started with `unthermal`:

\`\`\`python
from unthermal import Controller, System

# Define your system parameters
system = System(type='thermal', parameters={'gain': 1.0, 'time_constant': 5})

# Create a controller
controller = Controller(type='PID', parameters={'P': 0.5, 'I': 0.1, 'D': 0.05})

# Analyze the system
response = controller.analyze(system)
print(response)
\`\`\`
