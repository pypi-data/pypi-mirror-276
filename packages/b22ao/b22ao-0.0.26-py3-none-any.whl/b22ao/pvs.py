'''
The following PV is a gate signal used to allow/inhibit acquisitions.
The signal responds to topup events, beam dump, and a manual override.
PV values: 0 = disallow; 1 = allow

Note that this is not the exact PV accessible via the EPICS screen.
That PV adjusts this result to the specific endstation in use (the
signal is inverted for one of them). The PV in use here is the
endstation-independent result of their gating logic.
