# PUCOTI

**A Purposeful Countdown Timer**

PUCOTI is a simple, honest countdown timer with a few useful features:

### Features:
- **Countdown**: Counts down to zero (and can go below zero).
- **Bell Alert**: Rings a bell when it hits zero.
- **Persistent Reminder**: Rings every 20 seconds until you acknowledge it. Don't forget to do the thing.
- **Set Intentions**: Write down what you intend to do during the countdown.
- **History**: Keeps a log of your intentions and how long you spent on each.
- **Large Font**: Uses the biggest font it can for visibility.
- **Sway Integration**: Automatically moves to the corner of your screen if you use Sway WM.
- **Total Time**: Shows the total time you've spent on the timer.
- **Configurable**: Change the bell sound, waste time changing colors, and more.
- **Basic Controls**: Add or subtract time, reset the timer, but not more.

PUCOTI is straightforward and gets the job done. Give it a try.
