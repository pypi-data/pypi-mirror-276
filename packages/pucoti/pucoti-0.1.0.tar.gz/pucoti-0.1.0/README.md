- **History**: Keeps a log of your intentions and how long you spent on each.
- **Large Font**: Uses the biggest font it can for visibility.
- **Sway Integration**: Automatically moves to the corner of your screen if you use Sway WM.
- **Total Time**: Shows the total time you've spent on the timer.
