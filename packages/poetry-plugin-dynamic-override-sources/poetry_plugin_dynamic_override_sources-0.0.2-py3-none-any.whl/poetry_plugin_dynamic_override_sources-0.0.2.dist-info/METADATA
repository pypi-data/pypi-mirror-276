# poetry-plugin-dynamic-override-sources

## Description

*poetry-plugin-dynamic-override-sources* is a [plugin](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/plugins/)
for [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager in python.

With pip, you can override the package index URL using [configuration files](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/)
or environment variables such as:

- `PIP_INDEX_URL`
- `PIP_PROXY`

However, with poetry there is no such option.  The pyproject.toml project configuration specifies one or more
[sources](https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/#package-sources) that are to be used for resolving packages from the artifact storage.

This plugin makes it possible to use environment variable overrides like:

- `PIP_INDEX_URL` will override `PyPI` source
- `POETRY_SOURCE_FOO_URL` will override the source named `FOO` with the specified url

## Usage
