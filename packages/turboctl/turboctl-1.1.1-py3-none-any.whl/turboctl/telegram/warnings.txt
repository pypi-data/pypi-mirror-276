0 "Pump temperature 1 has passed the warning threshold." "Forevacuum pressure too high.\n\nGas flow too high.\n\nFan defective.\n\nWater cooling switched off." "Check the ultimate pressure of the backing pump and install a bigger backing pump if required.\n\nSeal leak, check process.\n\nReplace fan.\n\nSwitch on water cooling."
