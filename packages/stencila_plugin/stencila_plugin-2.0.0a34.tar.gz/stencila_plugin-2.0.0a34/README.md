## Introduction

This package provides tools for writing a [Stencila](https://github.com/stencila/stencila) plugin.
Stencila plugins extend the functionality of Stencila, and are dynamically loaded at runtime.
They communicate with the core Stencila app via JSON-RPC over a port, or via stdin/stdout.
This package implements much of the core functionality for communication, and makes writing a plugin as simple as filling out a few python functions.

## âš¡ Usage

The plugin can be installed via `pip`.

`pip install stencila_plugin`

An example of how to write a plugin can be seen in this [repo](https://github.com/stencila/plugin-example-python).
