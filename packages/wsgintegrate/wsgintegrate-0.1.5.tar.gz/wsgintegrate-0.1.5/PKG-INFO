Description: WSGI Integration
        ================

        WSGI pipes
        
        
        wsgintegrate core
        -----------------
        
        ``wsgintegrate`` is dependends on pyloader for loading and
        calling python objects: http://k0s.org/hg/pyloader
        
        - wgintegrate: wsgintegrate provides an integration layer to support
