This file contains an implementation of a hierarchical state machine processor.
It allows for a straightforward JSON-style definition of the state machine, and
includes a very convenient timer function.

The state machine is described by states, events, transitions, and actions.
Then the state machine processor automatically executes based on events.

Reserved Words:
start_state  A state required by each state machine or state with more
             than one state or sub-state, to indicate which one to enter.
end_state  A state that exists for all state machines. It cannot have
           exiting transitions, nor exit actions. Enter actions can be
           defined by the user. Enter actions will be executed after all
           other sub-state and state exit actions are executed.
exit_all_states  An event which causes the current state to run its exit
                 actions, and then all parent states to do the same.
                 No further state machine action can happen after this.
TimerManager  Is an instance that holds and processes all the active
              timers within the system.
cond  Is the dictionary entry for conditions, and the value is a string
      which will resolve to True or False when executed.
acts  Is the actions which will be taken upon: entry to a state, exit
      from a state, or during a transition. It is a list of functions
      with parameters, which will be called in the order presented.
tran  Is the dictionary entry for transitions available for exiting a
      particular state.
auto  Is a special "event", in that it always triggers / happens. There
      can only be one transition with an "auto" event unless different
      conditions are applied to each "auto" transition.
      *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
      For situations where both an "auto" event is valid, and a specific
      event (and conditions) are valid (anywhere up the tree), the user-
      spelled-out event will be executed. This keeps "auto" as a
      convenience feature. So all user-defined transitions in the current
      state, and all parent states, are checked for event and conditions.
      If any match is found, then that transition will be taken. Only
      when no transitions are taken before getting back up to the "root"
      state, will the search re-start and look for an "auto" transition
      in the current and parent states.
root  Is a state-like entity that contains all top-most states defined
      by the user. It should NOT be referenced by the user, even though
      it will appear at the start of all state paths.
final  Is the name of any state from which there are no exiting tran-
       sitions. There can be multiple final states in a machine.
