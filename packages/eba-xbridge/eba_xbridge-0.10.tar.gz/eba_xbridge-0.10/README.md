# Xbridge (eba-xbridge)

## Description

This is a simple XBRL formatter that takes an XBRL XML file and formats it into
an XBRL CSV file for EBA taxonomies.

## Installation

To install the library, run the following command:

```bash
pip install eba-xbridge
```

## Conventions

This library is only intended to be able to convert EBA XBRL files, it is not a
generic XBRL-XML to XBRL-CSV converter.
