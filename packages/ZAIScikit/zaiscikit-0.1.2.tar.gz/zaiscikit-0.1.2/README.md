# Z-MachineLearningLibrary
Our Personal Machine Learning Library

This is a Machine Learning library that Abderrahmane Baidoune, Imane Rahali I would like to build in order to further our understanding of the algorithms and implement them from scratch with the help of numpy, no more.

Thus, optimization is not a concern to us, nor is documentation or code readability. Having said that, we will, and have tried to devote some effort to it !


## Features

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implementations of various machine learning algorithms.
- **No Dependencies**: Relies solely on numpy, avoiding other external dependencies.
- **Educational Focus**: Emphasis on understanding the underlying mechanics of algorithms.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- numpy

## Installation

You can install Z-MachineLearningLibrary via pip:

```bash
pip install ZAIScikit
```

Or clone the repository and install it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ZAIScikit.git
cd ZAIScikit
pip install -e .
```

## Future Improvements and additions

<h5 style="color:green"> All Models' features need to be 2D Arrays even if there is one feature </h3>
