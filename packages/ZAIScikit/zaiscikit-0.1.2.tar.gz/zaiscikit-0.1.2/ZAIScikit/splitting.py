    K-Folds cross-validator.

    Parameters:
    n_splits (int): Number of folds. Must be at least 2.
    shuffle (bool): Whether to shuffle the data before splitting into batches.
    random_state (int): When shuffle is True, random_state affects the ordering of the indices. Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.

    get_n_splits(X, y, groups): Returns the number of splitting iterations in the cross-validator.
