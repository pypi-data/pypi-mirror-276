## Overview

patho-pix is a Python package designed to automate preprocessing of digital pathology images, leveraging existing processing frameworks into a modular pipeline. This package uses raw whole-slide-images (WSIs) and corresponding labels to preprocess the WSIs, It organizes and cleans up the input data into ready-to-use tiles and metadata, ensuring high-quality data for downstream machine learning analysis. Patho-pix integrates several key steps, including extraction of tissue regions ommiting background, tiling of the WSI, color normalization, artifact detection and removal and exportation of the tiles and metadata.

## Features

- **Tissue Region Extraction**: Identifies and focuses on tissue-covered regions, excluding the background of the image.
- **Tiling**: Divides WSIs into tiles of dynamic size (i.e. 1024x1024).
- **Color Normalization**: Color normalization across tiles for consistency.
- **Artifact Detection**: Identifies and removes tiles with artifacts (Upcoming feature).
- **Artifact Removal**: The pipeline provides two options to deal with artifacts. Corrupted tiles can either be thrown away and disregarded for further analysis. Alternatively a generative AI can be applied enhancing image quality by removing artifacts and filling in the missing data (Upcoming feature).
- **Export Tiles & Metadata**: Saves processed tiles and associated metadata for further use.

## Usage
To use patho pix you need to manually install the OpenSlide C-library as a dependency.
- Mac (with homebrew): `brew install openslide`.
- Linux (with the package manager of your choice): e.g., Ubuntu: sudo apt install `openslide-tools`
- Windows: Take a look at the [OpenSlide Docu](https://openslide.org)
