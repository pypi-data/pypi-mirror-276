# Botasaurus Driver

Botasaurus Driver is a powerful Driver Automation Python library that offers the following benefits:


- It is really humane; it looks and works exactly like a real browser, allowing it to access any website.
- Compared to Selenium and Playwright, it is super fast to launch and use.
- The API is designed by and for web scrapers, and you will love it.

## Installation
```bash
pip install botasaurus-driver
```

## Bypassing Bot Detection: Code Example

```python
from botasaurus_driver import Driver

driver = Driver()
driver.google_get("https://www.g2.com/products/github/reviews.html?page=5&product_id=github", bypass_cloudflare=True)
driver.prompt()
heading = driver.get_text('.product-head__title [itemprop="name"]')
print(heading)
```

**Result**

## API
Botasaurus Driver provides several handy methods for web automation tasks such as:

- Navigate to URLs:
  ```python
  driver.get("https://www.example.com")
  driver.google_get("https://www.example.com")  # Use Google as the referer [Recommended]
  driver.get_via("https://www.example.com", referer="https://duckduckgo.com/")  # Use custom referer
  driver.get_via_this_page("https://www.example.com")  # Use current page as referer
  ```

- For finding elements:
  ```python
  from botasaurus.browser import Wait
  search_results = driver.select(".search-results", wait=Wait.SHORT)  # Wait for up to 4 seconds for the element to be present, return None if not found
  search_results = driver.wait_for_element(".search-results", wait=Wait.LONG)  # Wait for up to 8 seconds for the element to be present, raise exception if not found
  hello_mom = driver.get_element_with_exact_text("Hello Mom", wait=Wait.VERY_LONG)  # Wait for up to 16 seconds for an element having the exact text "Hello Mom"
  ```

- Interact with elements:
  ```python
  driver.type("input[name='username']", "john_doe")  # Type into an input field
  driver.click("button.submit")  # Clicks an element
  element = driver.select("button.submit")
  element.click()  # Click on an element
  ```

- Retrieve element properties:
  ```python
  header_text = driver.get_text("h1")  # Get text content
  error_message = driver.get_element_containing_text("Error: Invalid input")
  image_url = driver.select("img.logo").get_attribute("src")  # Get attribute value
  ```

- Work with parent-child elements:
  ```python
  parent_element = driver.select(".parent")
  child_element = parent_element.select(".child")
  child_element.click()  # Click child element
  ```

- Execute JavaScript:
  ```python
  result = driver.run_js("return document.title")
  text_content = element.run_js("(el) => el.textContent")
  ```

- Working with iframes:
  ```python
  driver.get("https://www.g2.com/products/github/reviews.html?page=5&product_id=github")
  iframe = driver.select_iframe("#turnstile-wrapper iframe")
  text_content = iframe.select("body label").text
  ```

- Miscellaneous:
  ```python
  form.type("input[name='password']", "secret_password")  # Type into a form field
  container.is_element_present(".button")  # Check element presence
  page_html = driver.page_html  # Current page HTML
  driver.select(".footer").scroll_into_view()  # Scroll element into view
  driver.close()  # Close the browser
  ```
