Introduction
============

Welcome to the ERLabPy user guide! This guide provides an overview of ERLabPy and its
core features.

If you are new to programming with python, `Scientific Python Lectures
<https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures>`_ is a great place to start.

Data structures in ERLabPy are represented using `xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/>`_\
:cite:p:`hoyer2017xarray`, which provides a powerful data structure for working with
multi-dimensional arrays. Check out the `xarray tutorial <https://tutorial.xarray.dev/>`_
and the `xarray user guide <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html>`_ to get
familiar with xarray.
