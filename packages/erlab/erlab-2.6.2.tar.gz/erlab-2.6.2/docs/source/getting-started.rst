Installing
==========

The recommended way to install ERLabPy is via conda. If you do not have conda installed,
follow the :ref:`installation instructions <Installing conda>`. Once you have a working
conda environment, you can install ERLabPy with the conda command line tool: ::

  conda install -c conda-forge erlab

Add any `optional dependencies`_ you want to install to the command above.

.. hint::

  If you are using macOS, you might experience degraded performance with the
  default BLAS and LAPACK libraries. For Apple Silicon macs, use `Accelerate
  <https://developer.apple.com/accelerate/>`_: ::

    conda install "libblas=*=*accelerate"

  For Intel macs, use `MKL
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html>`_:
  ::

    conda install "libblas=*=*mkl"

  To prevent conda from switching back to the default libraries, see the
  `conda-forge documentation
  <https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#switching-blas-implementation>`_.

If you donâ€™t use conda, you can install ERLabPy with pip: ::

  python -m pip install erlab

Optional dependency groups can be installed with the following commands: ::

  python -m pip install erlab[viz]       # Install optional dependencies for visualization
  python -m pip install erlab[perf]      # Install optional dependencies for performance
  python -m pip install erlab[misc]      # Install miscellaneous optional dependencies
  python -m pip install erlab[complete]  # Install all optional dependencies

If you wish to install ERLabPy from source, see the :doc:`contributing`.

Dependencies
============

ERLabPy is installed with many different python libraries. Some key packages and
links to their documentation are listed below as a reference. In particular,
this documentation assumes basic familiarity with the first four packages, which
will be sufficient for most use cases.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: auto

    * - Package
      - Used in
    * - `numpy <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/>`_
      - Computation and array manipulation, linear algebra
    * - `xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/>`_
      - Data storage and manipulation
    * - `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_
      - Plotting
    * - `scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/index.html>`_
      - Linear algebra, signal processing, and image processing
    * - `lmfit <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/>`_
      - Optimization problems including curve fitting
    * - `pyqtgraph <https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
      - Interactive plotting (i.e., imagetool)

ERLabPy also requires a Qt library such as PyQt5, PyQt6, PySide2, or PySide6. To
ensure compatibility and keep the namespace clean, ERLabPy imports Qt bindings
from `qtpy <https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy>`_, which will automatically
select the appropriate library based on what is installed.

See the :doc:`user-guide/index` to start using ERLabPy!

.. _optional dependencies:

Optional dependencies
---------------------

The following packages are optional dependencies that are not installed by default. They
are only used in specific functions, or is not used at all but is listed just for
convenience.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: auto

    * - Package
      - Description
    * - `csaps <https://github.com/espdev/csaps>`_
      - Multidimensional smoothing splines
    * - `ipywidgets <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets>`_
      - Interactive widgets
    * - `hvplot <https://github.com/holoviz/hvplot>`_ and `bokeh
        <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh>`_
      - Interactive plotting
    * - `cmasher <https://cmasher.readthedocs.io>`_,
        `cmocean <https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/>`_, and
        `colorcet <https://colorcet.holoviz.org>`_
      - More colormaps!
    * - `numbagg <https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg>`_ and `bottleneck
        <https://github.com/pydata/bottleneck>`_
      - Fast multidimensional aggregation, accelerates xarray

For a full list of dependencies and optional dependencies, take a look at the
``[project]`` and ``[project.optional-dependencies]`` section in `pyproject.toml
<https://github.com/kmnhan/erlabpy/blob/main/pyproject.toml>`_:

.. literalinclude:: ../../pyproject.toml
   :language: toml
   :start-at: dependencies = [
   :end-before: [project.urls]


Notes on compatibility
----------------------

- ERLabPy is tested on Python 3.11 and 3.12. It is not guaranteed to work on older
  versions of Python.
- There are some `known compatibility issues
  <https://github.com/kmnhan/erlabpy/issues/17>`_ with PyQt5 and PySide2, so it is
  recommended to use the newer PyQt6 or PySide6 if possible.
- If you meet any unexpected behaviour while using IPython's `autoreload extension
  <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html>`_, try
  excluding the following modules: ::

    %aimport -erlab.io.dataloader -erlab.accessors
