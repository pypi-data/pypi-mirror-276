# CobraFuzz: Parallel coverage-guided fuzz testing for Python

[![Makefile CI](https://github.com/senier/cobrafuzz/actions/workflows/makefile.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/senier/cobrafuzz/actions/workflows/makefile.yml)
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/senier/cobrafuzz/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/senier/cobrafuzz/actions/workflows/codeql.yml)

CobraFuzz is a parallel coverage-guided [fuzzer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fuzzing) for testing Python programs.
It is a fork of [pythonfuzz](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/fuzzers/pythonfuzz).

Fuzzing for safe languages like Python is a powerful strategy for finding bugs like unhandled exceptions, logic bugs and security bugs.
It makes a good addition to classic unit-testing.

## Usage

### Fuzz Target

The first step is to implement a function to be fuzz-tested, also called a fuzz target.
Here is an example of a simple fuzz target for the built-in `html` module

```python,examples/fuzz_htmlparser/fuzz.py
from cobrafuzz.main import CobraFuzz


@CobraFuzz
def fuzz(buf: bytes) -> None:
    from html.parser import HTMLParser

    try:
        parser = HTMLParser()
        parser.feed(buf.decode("ascii"))
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    fuzz()
```

Features of a fuzz target:

* `fuzz()` will call the fuzz target in an infinite loop with random data generated by the coverage-guided algorithm. The data is passed to the target in a separate process through the `buf` parameter.
* The function must catch and ignore any expected exceptions that arise when passing invalid input to the tested program.
* The fuzz target must call the test function / library with the passed buffer or a transformation on the test buffer if the structure is different or of different type.
* Fuzz functions can also implement application level checks to catch application or logical bugs. For example: decode the buffer with the library under test, encode it again, and check that both results are equal. To communicate the result, the fuzz target should throw an exception.
* CobraFuzz will report any unhandled exceptions as crashes.

### Running

The next step is to download CobraFuzz and then run the fuzzer:

```console
$ pip install cobrafuzz
[...]

$ python examples/fuzz_htmlparser/fuzz.py --crash-dir results fuzz --max-crashes 1
#0 READ units: 1 workers: 7 seeds: 1
#1 NEW     cov: 279 corp: 1 exec/s: 89 crashes: 0
#5 NEW     cov: 366 corp: 2 exec/s: 299 crashes: 0
#7 NEW     cov: 401 corp: 3 exec/s: 3124 crashes: 0
[...]
#154382 NEW     cov: 1086 corp: 50 exec/s: 22835 crashes: 0
#156521 NEW     cov: 1092 corp: 51 exec/s: 2797 crashes: 0
Crash dir created (results)
sample was written to results/crash-c76ab601df7d8513560ad3c1a38f43c715122b342637a4517a32d13dea03d3ce
sample = 3c215b2119
Found 1 crashes, stopping.
```

By default, CobraFuzz will use all CPUs available in the system (8 in this example: 1 coordination process and 7 independent workers).
Use the `-j` / `--num-workers` command line parameter to override the default.
In this example an unhandled exception is found in a few seconds.

### Corpus

CobraFuzz will generate and test various inputs in an infinite loop.

Seeds can be provided as a mix of files and directories by the `seeds` parameter.
If one of those seeds parameters is a directory, all regular files therein are used as seeds.
CobraFuzz can also start with an empty seed corpus, though some valid test-cases in the seed corpus may speed up the fuzzing substantially.

More fuzz target examples (for real and popular libraries) can be found in the examples directory.
