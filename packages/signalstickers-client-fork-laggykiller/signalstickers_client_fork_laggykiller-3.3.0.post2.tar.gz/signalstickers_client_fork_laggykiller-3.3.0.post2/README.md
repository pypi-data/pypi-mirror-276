# Python client for Signal stickers

A client to interact with the [Signal](https://signal.org/) stickers API.

+ Fetch sticker packs
+ Get images files
+ Upload sticker packs
+ etc.


> Note: despite its name, this client does not interacts with
> `signalstickers.org`, so information defined there (tags, etc.) will **not**
> be fetched.

> This client connects to the Signal sticker API. Please **do not flood it**
> (you'll be blocked anyway).

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install --user signalstickers-client
```

This module requires `cryptography`, `protobuf`, `anyio`, and `httpx` (but they
should be installed with the previous command).
 
## Usage

If you are not familiar with Signal stickers, read
[STICKERS_INTERNALS.md](STICKERS_INTERNALS.md) first.

### Downloading a pack
The `StickerPack` object returned by `await
StickersClient().get_pack(<pack_id>, <pack_key>)` exposes the following
attributes:

+ `id: str` the pack id. Equals to `pack_id`;
+ `key: str` the pack key. Equals to `pack_key`;
+ `title: str` the title of the pack;
+ `author: str` the author of the pack;
+ `nb_stickers: int` the number of stickers in the pack;
+ `cover: Sticker` the cover sticker;
+ `stickers: list[Sticker]` the list of stickers in the pack

A `Sticker` object exposes the following attributes:

+ `id: int` the id of the sticker in the pack;
+ `emoji: str` the emoji mapped to this sticker;
+ `image_data: bytes` the webp image of the sticker.


### Uploading a pack

Same thing, but use `LocalStickerPack` (that does not contains `id` and `key`)
instead of `StickerPack`.

**You will need your Signal credentials!**

To obtain them, run the Signal Desktop app with the flag `--enable-dev-tools`,
open the Developer Tools, **change the JavaScript context from `top` to
`Electron Isolated Context`** (cf. video below), and type
`window.reduxStore.getState().items.uuid_id` to get your USER, and
`window.reduxStore.getState().items.password` to get your PASSWORD.
