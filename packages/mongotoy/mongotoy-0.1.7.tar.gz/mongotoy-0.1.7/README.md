## Minimal Example
Let's begin with a minimal example by defining a document and performing CRUD operations on the database.

```python
import asyncio
from mongotoy import Document, Engine
import datetime


class Person(Document):
    name: str
    last_name: str
    dob: datetime.date

    
# Create database engine
db = Engine('test-db')


async def main():
    # Create a new Person instance
    person = Person(
        name='John',
        last_name='Doe',
        dob=datetime.date(1990, 12, 25)
    )    
    
    # Connect to the MongoDB database
    await db.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017')
    
    # Open a database session
    async with db.session() as session:
        
        # Save the person to the database
        await session.save(person)
        
        # Fetch all persons from database
        async for c in session.objects(Person):
            print(c.dump_dict())
            
        # Update person dob
        person.dob=datetime.date(1995, 10, 25)
        await session.save(person)
        
        # Delete person from database
        await session.delete(person)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```
