## Typing stubs for nanoid

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`nanoid`](https://github.com/puyuan/py-nanoid) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`nanoid`.

This version of `types-nanoid` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `nanoid==2.0.0`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/nanoid. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `4b6558c12ac43cd40716cd6452fe98a632ae65d7` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.0, pyright 1.1.365, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
